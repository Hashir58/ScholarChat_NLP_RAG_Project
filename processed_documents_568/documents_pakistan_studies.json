The constitution provides for a range of fundamental rights, including freedom of speech, religion, and association. However, these rights have often been restricted in practice, particularly in cases where they conflict with the dominant religious or cultural norms.\nFor example, blasphemy laws in Pakistan have been used to restrict freedom of speech and expression, particularly for religious minorities. Similarly, the country's patriarchal cultural norms have led to restrictions on women's rights and autonomy, despite constitutional guarantees of equality.\n\nLanguage Diversity in Pakistan\nPakistan is a linguistically diverse country, with more than 74 languages spoken throughout the country. Urdu is the official language of Pakistan, and it is widely spoken and understood throughout the country. Other prominent languages spoken in Pakistan include Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, Balochi, and Saraiki. The linguistic diversity in Pakistan is a reflection of the country's diverse ethnic groups, and each language has its unique cultural and historical significance.\nThe linguistic diversity in Pakistan poses both challenges and opportunities for the country. On one hand, the diversity of languages in Pakistan creates a sense of pride and identity for the different ethnic groups. Each language represents a unique cultural heritage that is passed down from generation to generation. However, the linguistic diversity in Pakistan can also create barriers to communication and integration, as people who speak different languages may have difficulty understanding each other. Additionally, language can become a source of conflict when certain groups try to impose their language on others or when the government gives preference to one language over others.",

    "content": "Challenges and Opportunities of Cultural Diversity in Pakistan\nThe cultural diversity in Pakistan poses both challenges and opportunities for the country. On one hand, the country's cultural diversity is a source of pride and identity for its people. It is a reflection of the country's rich history and heritage, and it contributes to the country's cultural richness. However, cultural diversity can also create barriers to communication and integration. People who speak different languages or follow different customs and traditions may have difficulty understanding each other, which can lead to conflict and misunderstandings.\nOne of the biggest challenges of cultural diversity in Pakistan is sectarianism and religious extremism. Pakistan has experienced several instances of sectarian violence in recent years, particularly between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Religious extremism has also been a significant challenge, with extremist groups promoting violence and intolerance towards minorities. These challenges have created a sense of insecurity among the people and have hindered the country's development. However, cultural diversity also presents significant opportunities for Pakistan. The country's diversity can be harnessed to promote social and economic development. The diversity of Pakistan's cultural heritage can be used to promote tourism and generate revenue for the country. Additionally, the country's diverse workforce can be harnessed to promote innovation and creativity in various fields, including business, science, and technology.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Pakistan is a culturally diverse country that is rich in history and heritage. The country's cultural diversity is a reflection of its unique social, political, and economic context. The cultural elements of Pakistan, such as its language, religion, customs, and traditions, contribute to the country's identity and shape the lives of its people. The diversity of Pakistan's cultural heritage presents both challenges and opportunities for the country. The challenges of sectarianism and religious extremism must be addressed to harness the country's cultural diversity's full potential. The opportunities presented by the country's cultural diversity must be harnessed to promote social and economic development and improve the lives of its people. Overall, the cultural diversity of Pakistan is a source of pride and identity for its people and contributes to the country's unique cultural richness.",

    "content": "The SDGs, providing a comprehensive long-term strategy for achieving inclusive growth and sustainable development.\n\nPOVERTY (SDG 1)\n\nEradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity.\n\nGlobally, millions of people are still living on less than US$1.25 a day, many lacking access to adequate food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Women are more likely to live in poverty than men due to unequal access to paid work and education.\n\nNew threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing access to basic resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.\n\nZero hunger (SDG 2)\n\nUnfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all people especially children have access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural practices: supporting small scale farmers and allowing equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity. Together with the other goals set out here, we can end hunger by 2030.\n\nHEALTH (SDG 3)\n\nThe deaths can be avoided through prevention and treatment, education, immunization campaigns, and healthcare. The Sustainable Development Goals make a bold commitment to various diseases like tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases by 2030. The aim is to achieve universal health coverage, and provide access to safe and affordable medicines and vaccines for all. Supporting research and development for vaccines is an essential part of this process as well.\n\nQUALITY EDUCATION (SDG 4)\n\nChildren from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural and urban areas also remain high.\n\nAchieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, to eliminate gender and wealth disparities, and achieve universal access to a quality higher education.\n\nGENDER EQUALITY (SDG 5)\n\nEnding all forms of discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, but it also crucial to accelerating sustainable development. It has been proven time and again, that empowering women and girls has a multiplier effect, and helps drive up economic growth and development across the board.\n\nThe SDGs aim to build on these achievements to ensure that there is an end to discrimination against women and girls everywhere.\n\nWATER SCARCITY (SDG 6)\n\nWater scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world, an alarming figure that is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures as a result of climate change.\n\nBy 2050, it is projected that at least one in four people will be affected by recurring water shortages.\n\nEnsuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires we invest in adequate infrastructure, provide sanitation facilities, and encourage hygiene at every level. Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems such as forests, mountains, wetlands and rivers is essential if we are to mitigate water scarcity. More international cooperation is also needed to encourage water efficiency and support treatment technologies in developing countries.\n\nAFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY (SDG 7)\n\nEnsuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind and thermal. Adopting cost-effective standards for a wider range of technologies could also reduce the global electricity consumption.\n\nExpanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy in all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth and help the environment.\n\nDECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH (SDG 8)\n\nThe SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity and technological innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this. With these targets in mind, the goal is to achieve full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women and men by 2030.\n\nINDUSTRY INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE (SDG 9)\n\nPromoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development. Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies.\n\nTechnological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency.\n\nTo end digital divide is to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nREDUCED INEQUALITIES (SDG 10)\n\nIncome inequality is a global problem that requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening divide.\n\nThese widening disparities require the adoption of sound policies to empower the bottom percentile of income earners, and promote economic inclusion of all regardless of gender, race or ethnicity.\n\nSUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES (SDG 11)\n\nExtreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces, and national and city governments struggle to accommodate the rising population in these areas. Making cities safe and sustainable means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing, and upgrading slum settlements. It also involves investment in public transport, creating green public spaces, and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive.\n\nMore than half of the world's population now live in urban areas. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces. The rapid growth of cities in the developing world, coupled with increasing rural to urban migration, has led to a boom in mega-cities.\n\nRESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION (SDG 12)\n\nEncouraging industries, businesses and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030. A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological path by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide, and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater for human use. The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants, are important targets to achieve this goal.\n\nCLIMATE ACTION (SDG 13)\n\nThere is no country in the world that is not experiencing first-hand the drastic effects of climate change. Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not take action now.\n\nThe annual average losses from earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones and flooding amount to hundreds of billions of dollars, in disaster risk management alone. This requires urgent collective action to tackle.\n\nLIFE BELOW WATER (SDG 14)\n\nOceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and we are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Marine pollution, an overwhelming majority of which comes from land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels.\n\nThe SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans.\n\nThe world's oceans their temperature, chemistry, currents and life drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole, and to counter balance the effects of climate change. Billions of people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods.\n\nLIFE ON LAND (SDG 15)\n\nHuman life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of our human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resource and means of development. Forests account for 30 percent of the Earth's surface, providing vital habitats for millions of species and important sources for clean air and water; as well as being crucial for combating climate change.\n\nThe SDGs aim to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, drylands and mountains by 2020. Halting deforestation is also vital to mitigating the impact of climate change. Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common heritage.\n\nPEACE JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS (SDG 16)\n\nWithout peace, stability, human rights and effective governance, based on the rule of law, we cannot hope for sustainable development. We are living in a world that is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy sustained levels of peace, security and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is by no means inevitable and must be addressed. High levels of violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country's development, affecting economic growth.\n\nThe SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and work with governments and communities to find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity. Strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights is key to this process.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS (SDG 17)\n\nThe SDGs can only be realized with a strong commitment to global partnership and cooperation.\n\nPromoting international trade, and helping developing countries increase their exports, is all part of achieving a universal rules-based and equitable trading system that is fair and open, and benefits all.\n\nThe world today is more interconnected than ever before. Improving access to technology and knowledge is an important way to share ideas and foster innovation. Coordinating policies to help developing countries manage their debt, as well as promoting investment for the least developed, is vital to achieve sustainable growth and development.",

Normally this radiation would escape into space, but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter.\n\nThese heat-trapping pollutants specifically carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated gases are known as greenhouse gases, and their impact is called the greenhouse effect.\n\nClimate Change - Air pollution\n\nAir pollution is a major problem confronting Pakistan, with cities like Lahore and Karachi ranking among the most polluted worldwide.\n\nClimate Change - Deforestation\n\nThere is growing recognition within the international community that deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries play a significant role as ‘cause and effect’ of climate change.\n\nWhen trees are growing, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but when they are destroyed they release all the carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere, causing global warming. Deforestation is responsible for about 20% of global warming.\n\nSpecies extinction\n\nVarious studies indicate that climate change is affecting, directly or indirectly, the flora and fauna as well as their habitats leading to their displacement and in most severe cases, even extinction. Climate change is also affecting the competitiveness of different species by differently altering their growth, mortality rates and regeneration success rates. This may adversely affect synchronous functioning of life cycles of plants, animals and soil organisms.\n\nPopulations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and hunting, and the international union for conservation of nature has rated the bird's status as \"endangered\".\n\nOzone layer depletion\n\nOzone layer depletion causes increased UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface, which is damaging to human health. Negative effects include increases in certain types of skin cancers, eye cataracts and immune deficiency disorders. UV rays also affect plant growth, reducing agricultural productivity.",

    "content": "Pakistan's economy is characterized by three main sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. Agriculture has traditionally been a major sector, serving as the primary occupation for a significant portion of the population, providing food, raw materials for industries, and foreign exchange. It contributes substantially to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs a large part of the labor force. Key agricultural outputs include wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables.\n\nThe industrial sector is considered crucial for economic development and prosperity. Major industries include textiles (a significant export earner), sugar, cement, iron and steel, paper, defense production, fertilizers, and vehicle manufacturing. The services sector, which includes tourism, also plays a significant role in the economy.\n\nNatural resources are vital for Pakistan's economic stability. The country possesses considerable mineral resources such as iron ore, chromite, gypsum, coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium, which are essential for industrial activity and energy generation. Rivers like the Indus and its associated canal systems are the backbone of agriculture through irrigation and also provide hydroelectric power. Forests provide timber, fuel, and support biodiversity, while animal husbandry contributes milk, meat, wool, and serves as a source of foreign exchange. Effective management and utilization of these resources are key to the nation's development.\n\nTrade significantly impacts Pakistan's economic stability. Major exports include textiles, leather goods, sports goods, chemicals, carpets, rice, sugar, and cotton. However, Pakistan also relies heavily on imports such as petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, fertilizers, capital goods, and industrial raw materials. The country has faced chronic balance of payments problems, particularly due to the high cost of oil imports, which contributes to trade imbalances and current account deficits. Thus, managing the balance of trade is critical for economic stability.",

    "content": "Pakistan possesses diverse and significant tourism potential. Two notable destinations are the Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nSwat Valley, located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, is often described as a place of stunning natural beauty with green fields, forests, picturesque villages, and clear blue rivers. The town of Kalam serves as a base to explore its attractions, including Boyun Village, Kandol and Spindhor Lakes, and the Ushu Forest. Economically, Swat's tourism potential lies in attracting domestic and international tourists, which generates revenue through accommodation, food services, transportation, and local handicrafts. This creates employment opportunities for the local population and stimulates local businesses. For Pakistan's international image, Swat, often dubbed the \"Switzerland of Pakistan,\" showcases the country's breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage beyond the often-negative media portrayals. Successfully promoting and managing tourism in Swat can help project an image of Pakistan as a beautiful, hospitable, and diverse travel destination.\n\nGilgit-Baltistan is another region with immense tourism potential, known for being home to some of the world's highest mountain peaks (like Nanga Parbat) and glaciers. Destinations like Fairy Meadows offer incredible views and attract adventurers, mountaineers, trekkers, and explorers. Economically, tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan can significantly enhance the well-being of local residents by providing job opportunities and increasing income through guiding, porter services, guesthouses, and the sale of local products. Infrastructure development related to tourism, such as hotels and transport, also contributes to the local economy. Internationally, Gilgit-Baltistan positions Pakistan as a prime destination for adventure tourism and mountaineering. The unique landscapes and the cultural richness of places like Hunza within Gilgit-Baltistan contribute to a positive and diverse image of the country, attracting specialized tourist segments and fostering international connections.\n\nBoth destinations, if developed and marketed effectively with proper infrastructure and security, can significantly boost foreign exchange earnings and improve Pakistan's global standing as a tourist-friendly country.\n\nSome notable mentions beside these destinations are:\n\nMurree\n\nBhurban\n\nPatriata\n\nChitral\n\nKaghan Valley\n\nKalash\n\nSkardu",

Focus on Pakistan's relations with the US and India.\n\nThe 9/11 terrorist attacks marked a watershed moment for Pakistan's foreign policy, leading to significant and complex shifts, particularly in its relations with the United States and India.\n\nRelations with the US: Immediately after 9/11, Pakistan became a crucial strategic ally for the United States in its \"War on Terror.\" This decision, as confessed by then-President Pervez Musharraf, was made under considerable pressure, as the US had threatened Pakistan if it did not cooperate. This alliance led to the lifting of US sanctions previously imposed on Pakistan and Pakistan being designated a major non-NATO ally. Pakistan played a key role in facilitating the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, permitting the transit of material across its territory. However, this relationship was fraught with challenges. The US often pressured Pakistan to \"do more\" to control Taliban militants and eliminate safe havens.\n\nA significant point of tension arose when the US launched a unilateral operation deep inside Pakistan. This operation resulted in the killing of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in 2011, further complicating bilateral ties. \n\nThe Pak-US relationship during this period is described as \"complex, troublesome, and transactional,\" based on instrumental exchange rather than ideological affinity, and has been termed \"clientelistic.\" Despite common goals, priorities often differed, and Pakistan remained concerned about its territorial integrity.\n\nRelations with India: While Pakistan was deeply engaged with the US on its western border, its relationship with India remained tense, with the Kashmir dispute as the primary source of conflict. The post-9/11 global focus on counter-terrorism brought new dimensions to Indo-Pak relations. India often blamed Pakistan for initiating insurgency in Kashmir, equating it with terrorism. Although there were periods of attempted dialogue, the underlying distrust and conflict persisted. Events like the 2019 Pulwama attack, which India attributed to Pakistan-based militants, brought the two nuclear-armed neighbors to the brink of war. Furthermore, India's abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, which scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, further sharpened tensions. The \"War on Terror\" dynamic sometimes saw increased international scrutiny on cross-border militancy, impacting Pakistan's leverage on the Kashmir issue.\n\nIn essence, post-9/11, Pakistan's foreign policy was characterized by a difficult balancing act: cooperating with the US in Afghanistan while managing the domestic fallout and navigating an increasingly complex relationship with India, all under the shadow of regional instability and the global fight against terrorism.",

What are the challenges and opportunities in these alliances?\n\nPakistan has been an active participant in several regional organizations, including the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), aiming to foster regional peace, stability, and economic development.\n\nContributions:\n\nIn SAARC, Pakistan is a founding member and has advocated for frameworks to stimulate cooperation and progress in South Asia. The organization aims to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development among member states.\n\nPakistan is also a founding member of ECO (originally RCD), which focuses on economic, technical, and cultural cooperation for sustainable development among its ten member states.\n\nMore recently, Pakistan became a full member of the SCO in 2017. The SCO focuses on regional security, combating terrorism, separatism, and extremism, alongside regional development. Pakistan offers the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as an economic pathway for SCO member countries, enhancing its socio-economic objectives.\n\nChallenges:\n\nA significant challenge, particularly within SAARC, is the persistent India-Pakistan rivalry, which has become a \"bottleneck\" hindering effective coordination and leading to the cancellation of summits. This has rendered SAARC largely ineffective in achieving its objectives, such as increasing intra-regional trade or significantly reducing poverty. For Pakistan, navigating relationships within these forums where India is also a member requires delicate diplomacy. Across all organizations, challenges include managing diverse national interests, lack of mutual trust among some members, internal political instability within member states, and resource constraints that can slow down the implementation of an organization's agenda.\n\nOpportunities:\n\nThese regional organizations offer significant opportunities. ECO and SCO present brighter prospects for Pakistan for broader regional engagement, especially in Central Asia. SCO membership, in particular, allows Pakistan to contribute to regional security narratives and development alongside major players like China and Russia. Participation in SCO can also enhance Pakistan's worldwide socio-economic objectives, especially through initiatives like CPEC.\n\nThese platforms provide avenues for dialogue on contentious issues, promotion of trade and investment, and collaboration on shared challenges like energy, environment, and connectivity. Successfully leveraging these alliances can help Pakistan strengthen its diplomatic ties, boost its economy, and play a more influential role in regional stability and prosperity. A flexible foreign policy and meaningful dialogue, particularly with neighbors, are crucial for Pakistan to maximize these opportunities.",

But Muslim League, which stood for separate electorates, was unfortunately divided in several factions owing to personal and ideological differences.\n\nCongress, on the other hand, was raising slogans of joint electorates. Congress also wanted Hindi to be declared as the official language in the Deva Nagri script, while Muslims were in favour of Urdu in Persian script to be officially declared as the national language of the Indian sub-continent.\n\nThe result of elections came as a huge shock to both the parties. Congress, who claimed to be representing 95% of the total Indian population, could not even secure 40% of the seats. It won almost 750 seats out of 1,771 in 8 out of 11 provinces. Its success was restricted to Hindu-majority provinces only.\n\nAs for the results for the Muslim League, they were greatly disappointing. Out of 491 Muslim seats, it could only get 106 and 26 of them were taken by Congress. Hence, the final success of the elections was named in the favor of Congress, which gained majority in Bihar, Orissa, Madras and U.P and other regions.\n\nThe Congress didn't set up ministries for about four months demanding British government to not interfere in its legislative affairs. Discussions between them took place, and at last, the British agreed without making any formal amendment to the Government of India Act 1935.\n\nAs a result of which, Congress ministries were formed in July 1937 but with bitter policy against Muslims: Hindi became the national language, Congress flag became the national flag, and Bande Matram became the national anthem. A strict prohibition was laid on cow slaughter. The singing of Bande Matram, taken from the novel of Chandra Chatterji, was started in schools. Construction of new mosques was banned and Muslims were harassed while they offered prayers.",

Congress, who claimed to be representing 95% of the total Indian population, could not even secure 40% of the seats. It won almost 750 seats out of 1,771 in 8 out of 11 provinces. Its success was restricted to Hindu-majority provinces only.\n\nAs for the results for the Muslim League, they were greatly disappointing. Out of 491 Muslim seats, it could only get 106 and 26 of them were taken by Congress. Hence, the final success of the elections was named in the favor of Congress, which gained majority in Bihar, Orissa, Madras and U.P and other regions.\n\nThe Congress didn't set up ministries for about four months demanding British government to not interfere in its legislative affairs. Discussions between them took place, and at last, the British agreed without making any formal amendment to the Government of India Act 1935.\n\nAs a result of which, Congress ministries were formed in July 1937 but with bitter policy against Muslims: Hindi became the national language, Congress flag became the national flag, and Bande Matram became the national anthem. A strict prohibition was laid on cow slaughter. The singing of Bande Matram, taken from the novel of Chandra Chatterji, was started in schools. Construction of new mosques was banned and Muslims were harassed while they offered prayers.",

Therefore, it will treat its own minorities with justice, equality and respect, and will not only be accommodating but also be generous towards its own minorities.\n\nOn 3rd February 1948 in Karachi, Quaid e Azam assured Parsi community that Pakistan would be true to its often repeated promises. He told them Pakistan is the fulfillment of dream of a nation which found itself a minority in the Indian sub-continent. Therefore Pakistan can never forget the minorities living within its borders.\n\nHe said in 1929:\n\nAll legislative in the country and other elected bodied shall be constituted on definite principles of adequate and effective representation of minorities in ever province without reducing the majority in any province to a minority or even equality.\n\n\"In any case Pakistan is not going to be a theocratic State to be ruled by priests with a divine mission.

The lake has a very diverse range of flora and fauna.\n\nGlaciers\n\nA glacier is a huge mass of ice that moves slowly over land.\n\nThe term “glacier” comes from the French word glace (glah-SAY), which means ice. Glaciers are often called “rivers of ice.” Glaciers fall into two groups: alpine glaciers and ice sheets.\n\nGlaciers in Pakistan\n\nPakistan has some of the world’s highest and most spectacular mountains. A total of 13 of the world’s 30 tallest peaks are located there, including K2 (8,611 m), the second highest peak in the world, Nanga Parbat (8,125 m), the ninth highest peak, and Tirich Mir (7,690 m) in the Hindu Kush.\n\nThe glaciated area in northern Pakistan is estimated to cover 15,000 km², and as much as 37 percent of the Karakoram region is covered by glaciers.\n\nAccording to an estimate there are more than 7259 glaciers in Pakistan.",

The age limit of a candidate for a seat in the National Assembly was 25 years. The Parliament consisted of only one house which was known as National Assembly.\n\nParliamentary form of Government\nIt provided a Parliamentary form of Government. The prime minister was head of the Government, and all the cabinet members were chosen from the Parliament. The members of the cabinet were accountable to the Parliament collectively. Any Muslim citizen of Pakistan, who was at least forty years old, could be elected as the President of Pakistan for the term of five years. No one was entitled to hold this office for more than two tenures. 3/4th members of the Assembly could impeach the president.\n\nFederalism\nThe constitution provided for the federal form of government with three lists of subjects: federal, provincial and concurrent. The federal list consisted of 33 items, provincial of 94 items, and a concurrent list of 19 items. So, Federalism was provided by the 1956 Constitution of Pakistan.

The Supreme Court was responsible for the enforcement and could declare any law or order as null and void if it was against the fundamental rights. However, the President had the power to suspend fundamental rights in case of emergency.\n\nIslamic Provisions:\nSovereignty belongs to Allah and no law should be made against Islam.\n\nNational Languages:\nUrdu and Bengali were declared as the state languages.

But it subsisted for 2 years 4 months and 19 days.\n\nFirst Constitution of Pakistan was abrogated and Martial Law was enforced in the country.\n\nPresident Sikandar Mirza abrogated the Constitution, dissolved the National and Provincial Assemblies, and declared Martial Law, on 7th October 1958.",

    "content": "Constitution of 1962\n\nAs constitution was required to run the country, after almost four years of General Ayub Khan rule in the country second constitution was introduced. The 1962 constitution came into existence and was implemented on June 8, 1962 which introduced the Presidential form of Government.\n\nSalient Constitution of 1962\n\nWritten and Detailed Document\nThe 1962 constitution was written that consisted of 250 Articles and 3 Schedules. Thus it was comparatively detailed document. Keeping in view the lack of democratic values and established norms it was thought expedient to give a detailed code of constitutional law as could regulate the conduct of different political institutions.\n\nIncorporation of Objectives Resolution\nThe preamble of the 1962 constitution contained the Objectives Resolution 1949.\n\nProvision of parity of representation at the center\nAccording to the constitution, the central assembly (national assembly) would contain an equal number of representatives both from East and West Pakistan. There would be a total of 300 national assembly members, 150 from each unit.\n\nFederal System\nUnder the constitution of 1962 federal system was adopted. The powers of the central government were enumerated in the Federal List while all the residuary powers were given to the provinces so as to meet the demand of provincial autonomy. However, within this federal structure, the central government was made domineering even at the cost of provincial autonomy. Besides in the administrative matters, centralism was clearly reflected. The provincial governors were the appointees of President and accountable to him.\n\nHence the provincial executive was under the control of the center. This centralism bore more disastrous results in respect of provincial autonomy. Consequently, the federal structure practically seemed unitary due to which the demand of provincial autonomy became more popular and widespread which threatened solidarity in the later stage.\n\nPresidential form of Government\nAccording to the 1962 constitution, it would be a presidential form of government in Pakistan. The president would be the head of the executive as well as the head of the state. The president enjoyed the power to issue ordinances that would take the shapes of law. No court and legislature would challenge presidential orders. The president could appoint and remove ministers and provincial governors. The president could veto any law made by the national assembly. Only a citizen of Pakistan with an age over 35 years would be eligible for the post of president.\n\nPresidential form of Government\nAll the executive authority was vested in the President who was unanimously responsible for the business of the central government. The president also enjoyed certain legislative, military and judicial powers. The provincial set up also followed the central structure. In short, it was the President who was all in all.\n\nUnicameral/One House Parliament\nThe 1962 Constitution provided unicameral legislature/one House Parliament at the center (the National Assembly) with an equal number of representatives from each province. Its total strength was raised upto 313, who were elected by the electoral college of Basic Democrats. Besides, certain seats were also reserved for women. Its term was 5 years, which was fixed. The members were elected on the basis of parity of representation between East and West wing. The proceedings of the Assembly might not be challenged in any court of law. Unlike the previous practices the members of the cabinet were not the members of the legislature.\n\nIndirect Selection\nIt was a new innovation in the 1962 constitution. It was a general impression that one of the causes of the failure of the constitutional machinery was the direct election without proper and necessary political education and training. Hence this constitution provided indirect method of election for President and for the legislative assemblies. Accordingly, the primary voters would elect the Basic Democrats who had then to elect the representatives to higher positions.\n\nFundamental Rights and Principles of Policy\nIn the original constitution there was no list of fundamental rights. It was due to the first amendment in the constitution in 1963 that these were included and made its part. The list of fundamental rights contained almost all the rights secured to its citizens by a modern state. The principles of policy were also incorporated in the constitution. Most of the Islamic provisions were made the part thereof. These principles of policy dealt with such matters as Islamic way of life, national integration and solidarity, social welfare, protection of the rights of minorities, development of backward areas etc.\n\nAlthough the 1962 constitution of Pakistan had transferred several responsibilities to the provincial governments but in actual practice the central government or its representatives used to exercise these powers.",

The First Amendment redefined the international and provisional boundaries, federal treaties of Pakistan, and naval treaties of Pakistan. The amendment eliminates and removed the references of East Pakistan after the recognition of Bangladesh.\n\nSecond Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan became part of the constitution on September 17, 1974. It declared that Ahmadis as non-Muslims.\n\nFourth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan is an amendment that became part on November 21, 1975. The Amendment decreed the seats for minorities and non-Muslims representation to the government of Pakistan and the Parliament of Pakistan, to protect the minority rights in the country.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan adopted on December 22, 1976. The VI Amendment stated that Chief Justice of Supreme Court will be retired at the age of 65 and a High Court honorable judge shall be retired at the age of 62.\n\nSeventh Amendment was also the last of seven amendments adopted on 16 May 1977, a month before the ending of the democratic government of Prime minister Zulfikar Bhutto. The Seventh Amendment orders and enables the people elected Prime Minister to obtain a Vote of confidence by the members of Parliament.\n\nEighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan allowed the President to unilaterally dissolve the National Assembly and elected governments. The eighth amendment was drafted and later enforced by the technocratic-military government of General Zia-ul-Haq. The eighth amendment changed Pakistan's system of government from a parliamentary democracy to a semi-presidential system. The eighth amendment strengthened the authority of the President and also granted additional powers to dismiss the elected Prime Minister's government. These powers included the right, expressed in sub-section 2(b) inserted into Article 58, to dissolve the National Assembly but not the Senate.\n\nThirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan was a short-lived amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, adopted by the Parliament of Pakistan in 1997 by the civilian government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It took power from the President of Pakistan to dissolve the National Assembly and dismissing the Prime Minister. The Constitutional Amendment was supported by both the government and the opposition, and was thus passed unanimously. With the enforcing of this amendment, Pakistan's system of government was shifted from Semi-presidential system to Parliamentary democratic republic system.\n\nSeventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan was an amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan passed in December 2003. This amendment made many changes to Pakistan's constitution. Many of these changes dealt with the office of the president and the reversal of the effects of the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Eighteenth Amendment was passed by the National Assembly of Pakistan on April 8, 2010, eradicated the power of the President of Pakistan to dissolve the Parliament unilaterally, turning Pakistan from a semi-presidential to a parliamentary and renaming North-West Frontier Province to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It was to counter the sweeping powers amassed by the presidency under military rulers and to ease political instability in Pakistan. The amendment bill was passed by the Senate of Pakistan on April 15, 2010. It was the first time in Pakistan's history that a president relinquished a significant part of his powers willingly and transferred them to parliament and the office of the prime minister.",

Effective management and human efforts are needed to avail them. Modern technology is also required to make use of it.\n\nNatural Resources - Minerals\n\nPakistan is blessed with considerable mineral resources. Some of them are explored but much remains to be done for the search for more. Some important resources are discussed here.\n\nNatural Resources - Minerals: Iron Ore\n\nIron Ore is used for industry, especially steel industry. Iron ore is found in various regions of Pakistan including Nokundi, Chiniot, Kalabagh the largest one, Haripur and other northern areas.\n\nIron ore is among the top five minerals found in Pakistan. The Kalabagh iron deposit is one of the largest in the country.\n\nIn February 2015, reserves were found in Chiniot, around 160 kilometres northwest of Lahore, by a Chinese group, the Metallurgical Cooperation of China.\n\nNatural Resources - Minerals: Chromites\n\nChromites is used in preparing other metals, leather tanning, making of steel products, armament and stainless steel. Sizable deposits of this mineral are found at Muslimbagh, district Killa Saifullah. Lasbela, Khuzdar, Kharan and Chaghi districts have chromite reserves. Private sector has been engaged in mining this mineral.\n\nNatural Resources - Minerals: Gypsum\n\nGypsum is used for plaster of Paris, Paints and Cement.\n\nThe main Gypsum deposits occur in the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan District. The deposits occur in the north-south trending ridges that form the foot-hills of the Suleman Range, West of Dera Ghazi Khan.\n\nNatural Resources - Minerals: Coal\n\nPakistan has coal deposits in Sindh, Punjab and Baluchistan. The total coal resources of Pakistan are reported to be approximately 185 Billion tons. Coal is used in power generation. It is basically used as fuel.\n\nNatural Resources - Minerals: Oil and Gas\n\nOil: Pakistan remains an importer of refined oil because of the low capacity of domestic refineries to process crude oil. It is a major source of energy. It is mostly imported from Iran and Gulf states.\n\nGas: It is itself a source of energy and fuel, and also used as a source of power generation.\n\nNatural Resources - Minerals: Uranium\n\nUranium: It is the basic element for atomic power, indispensable for the defense. Uranium deposits were found in several locations in Pakistan. The Atomic Energy Minerals Centre (AEMC) in Lahore was responsible for the exploration and mining operations. The Siwalik Hills, west of Dera Ghazi Khan, was indentified as the most promising location. Pakistan does not have high grade uranium ore in the country.

Pakistan's irrigation system, built by the British in the 1800s, is a complex network that brings water from the rivers to the canals and, in turn, through distributaries.\n\nThe Indus Basin Project is a water control project that resulted from a treaty, Indus Waters Treaty, signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 that guaranteed that Pakistan would receive water from the Indus River independent from upstream control by India. Indus Waters Treaty was signed on September 19, 1960, between India and Pakistan.\n\nWater is dangerous if it is too much, it become a problem if it is too little. It is used for Agriculture where it is the backbone of agro-economy (Agro-based industry would mean any activity involved in cultivation, under controlled conditions of agricultural). It is also a cheapest source of hydroelectric Power generation.\n\nMajor Rivers of Pakistan\n\nThe river system of the country is originated from the snow-covered Karakoram and Himalayan range.\n\nRiver system of Pakistan mainly comprises of five rivers that pass mostly through the Punjab province; therefore the name 'Punjab' 'panj' meaning five and 'aab' meaning water.\n\nThe five main rivers of Pakistan are;\nJhelum,\nChenab,\nRavi,\nSultej\nIndus\n\nBeing the 3rd largest agricultural economy in the whole world, Pakistan's rivers are the most important sources of water that are used in agriculture for all domestic usage and in the irrigation system.\n\nRivers: Specific Descriptions\n\nIndus River is taken to be one of the longest rivers in Asia. The Indus river is the longest river in Pakistan, originating from the Himalayan region. The Indus River fulfils the water requirements of Pakistan and is the main support for agriculture.\n\nJhelum River is a river that flows from the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, through the Pakistani-administered territory of Azad Kashmir, and into Pakistani Punjab.\n\nSutlej flows through the historic crossroad region of Punjab in northern India and Pakistan.\n\nChenab flows through Jammu and Kashmir. It is then joined by the Jhelum River at Trimmu, a flood control mechanism near Jhang and on moving further it merges with the Sutlej.\n\nRiver Ravi like many other rivers of the region, originates in the Himalayas.

That referendum has yet to be held.\n\nThe region of Kashmir is one of the most unstable areas in the world. The nations of India and Pakistan have fiercely contested each other over Kashmir. The conflict that started after the partition of India in 1947 as both India and Pakistan claimed the entirety of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is a dispute over the region that escalated into wars between India and Pakistan and several other armed skirmishes. It has gained immense international attention given the fact that both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers and this conflict represents a threat to global security.\n\nThe British, led by the then Governor-General Louis Mountbatten, divided the British India empire into the states of India and Pakistan. The British India Empire was made up of multiple princely states (states that were allegiant to the British but headed by a monarch) along with states directly headed by the British. At the time of the partition, princely states had the right to choose whether they were to cede to India or Pakistan. In general, the Muslim majority states went to Pakistan while the Hindu majority states went to India, although India was a secular nation.\n\nKashmir was a peculiar case. While the majority of the population was Muslim, the ruler was a Hindu, Maharaja Hari Singh. However, this was not the only such case. The state of Junagadh was also faced with such a conflict. The ruler of Junagadh was a Muslim, who wished to accede to Pakistan, against the wishes of his people. Mountbatten recommended that Junagadh should go to India not only because it was a largely populated state but also because it was completely surrounded by India. However, the ruler relinquished to Pakistan. India, enraged, taken over Junagadh.\n\nHowever, when it came to the region of Kashmir, the situation unfolded differently. Although Kashmir was a Muslim majority state headed by a Hindu ruler, Mountbatten recommended that Kashmir should go to India. But Hari Singh decided that Kashmir would be independent, at least for a while, because he feared that the Kashmiri Muslims would not be happy with India while the Hindus and Sikhs would not be happy in Pakistan. During this period of ambivalence in Kashmir, there were outbursts of riots in certain districts of Kashmir against the ruler.\n\nHari Singh made a plea to India to aid him against this anarchy and in doing so ceded Kashmir to India. This led to the First Indo-Pakistani War, also known as the First Kashmir War that was fought between the Indian soldiers and the Pakistani tribesmen. Towards the end of 1948, both sides solidified their positions in Kashmir. A ceasefire agreement was made and a line of control (LOC) was established. The United Nations then played the role of the mediator. Further International negotiations were attempted. However, these too failed.",

This led to the First Indo-Pakistani War, also known as the First Kashmir War that was fought between the Indian soldiers and the Pakistani tribesmen. Towards the end of 1948, both sides solidified their positions in Kashmir. A ceasefire agreement was made and a line of control (LOC) was established. The United Nations then played the role of the mediator. Further International negotiations were attempted. However, these too failed.",
