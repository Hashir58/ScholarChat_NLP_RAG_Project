An image, \nauthentic as well as comprehensive, of this Message is therefore only attainable \nthrough careful study and profound analysis of both backgrounds and issues of such \na biography.

During this period, the tribe of Himyar \nconquered the kingdom of Sheba and took Redan for capital instead of Ma’rib. \nLater on, Redan was called \"Zifar\". Its ruins still lie on Mudawwar Mountain \nnear the town of \"Yarim\". During this period, they began to decline and fall. \nTheir trade failed to a very great extent, firstly, because of the Nabetean \ndomain over the north of Hijaz; secondly, because of the Roman superiority \nover the naval trade routes after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Syria and the \nnorth of Hijaz; and thirdly, because of the inter-tribal warfare. Thanks to the \nthree above-mentioned factors, families of Qahtan were disunited and \nscattered out. \n4. From 300 A.D. until Islam dawned on Yemen. This period witnessed a lot of \ndisorder and turmoil. The great many and civil wars rendered the people of \nYemen liable to foreign subjection and hence loss of independence. During \nthis era, the Romans conquered ‘Adn and even helped the Abyssinians \n(Ethiopians) to occupy Yemen for the first time in 340 A.D., making use of the \nconstant intra-tribal conflict of Hamdan and Himyar. The Abyssinian \n(Ethiopian) occupation of Yemen lasted until 378 A.D., whereafter Yemen \nregained its independence. Later on, cracks began to show in Ma’rib Dam \nwhich led to the Great Flood (450 or 451 A.D.) mentioned in the Noble Qur’? . \n\n15\nThis was a great event which caused the fall of the entire Yemeni civilization \nand the dispersal of the nations living therein. \nIn 523, Dhu Nawas, a Jew, despatched a great campaign against the Christians of \nNajran in order to force them to convert into Judaism.

During this period, the tribe of Himyar \nconquered the kingdom of Sheba and took Redan for capital instead of Ma’rib. \nLater on, Redan was called \"Zifar\". Its ruins still lie on Mudawwar Mountain \nnear the town of \"Yarim\". During this period, they began to decline and fall. \nTheir trade failed to a very great extent, firstly, because of the Nabetean \ndomain over the north of Hijaz; secondly, because of the Roman superiority \nover the naval trade routes after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Syria and the \nnorth of Hijaz; and thirdly, because of the inter-tribal warfare. Thanks to the \nthree above-mentioned factors, families of Qahtan were disunited and \nscattered out. \n4. From 300 A.D. until Islam dawned on Yemen. This period witnessed a lot of \ndisorder and turmoil. The great many and civil wars rendered the people of \nYemen liable to foreign subjection and hence loss of independence. During \nthis era, the Romans conquered ‘Adn and even helped the Abyssinians \n(Ethiopians) to occupy Yemen for the first time in 340 A.D., making use of the \nconstant intra-tribal conflict of Hamdan and Himyar. The Abyssinian \n(Ethiopian) occupation of Yemen lasted until 378 A.D., whereafter Yemen \nregained its independence. Later on, cracks began to show in Ma’rib Dam \nwhich led to the Great Flood (450 or 451 A.D.) mentioned in the Noble Qur’? . \n\n15\nThis was a great event which caused the fall of the entire Yemeni civilization \nand the dispersal of the nations living therein. \nIn 523, Dhu Nawas, a Jew, despatched a great campaign against the Christians of \nNajran in order to force them to convert into Judaism. Having refused to do so, they \nwere thrown alive into a big ditch",

They enjoyed no privileges in Makkah or in the Sacred House until \nthe appearance of Qusai bin Kilab, whose father is said to have died when he was \nstill a baby, and whose mother was subsequently married to Rabi‘a bin Haram, from \nthe tribe of Bani ‘Udhra. Rabi‘a took his wife and her baby to his homeland on the \nborders of Syria. When Qusai became a young man, he returned to Makkah, which \nwas ruled by Halil bin Habsha from Khuza‘a, who gave Qusai his daughter, Hobba, as \nwife. After Halil’s death, a war between Khuza‘a and Quraish broke out and resulted \nin Qusai’s taking hold of Makkah and the Sacred House. [Ibn Hisham 1/117] \nThe Reasons of this War have been illustrated in Three Versions \nThe First: Having noticed the spread of his offspring, increase of his property and \nexalt of his honour after Halil’s death, Qusai found himself more entitled to shoulder \nresponsibility of rulership over Makkah and custodianship of the Sacred House than \nthe tribes of Khuza‘a and Bani Bakr. He also advocated that Quraish were the chiefs \nof Ishmael’s descendants. Therefore he consulted some men from Quraish and \nKinana concerning his desire to evacuate Khuza‘a and Bani Bakr from Makkah. They \ntook a liking to his opinion and supported him. \nThe Second: Khuza‘a claimed that Halil requested Qusai to hold custodianship of Al-\nKa‘bah and rulership over Makkah after his death. \nThe Third: Halil gave the right of Al-Ka‘bah service to his daughter Hobba and \nappointed Abu Ghabshan Al-Khuza‘i to function as her agent whereof. Upon Halil’s \ndeath, Qusai bought this right for a leather bag of wine, which aroused \ndissatisfaction among the men of Khuza‘a and they tried to keep the custodianship of \nthe Sacred House away from Qusai.

If the lot showed ‘yes’, they would do, if ‘no’, they would delay for the next \nyear. Other kinds of Azlam were cast for water, blood-money or showed ‘from you’, \n‘not from you’, or ‘Mulsaq’ (consociated). In cases of doubt in filiation they would \nresort to the idol of Hubal, with a hundred-camel gift, for the arrow caster. Only the \narrows would then decide the sort of relationship. If the arrow showed (from you), \nthen it was decided that the child belonged to the tribe; if it showed (from others), \nhe would then be regarded as an ally, but if (consociated) appeared, the person \nwould retain his position but with no lineage or alliance contract.

Their sole target turned into acquisition of wealth and power even if it were at \nthe risk of losing their religion, or the emergence of atheism and disbelief. \nChristianity likewise opened its doors wide to polytheism, and got too difficult to \ncomprehend as a heavenly religion. As a religious practice, it developed a sort of \npeculiar medley of man and God. It exercised no bearing whatsoever on the souls of \nthe Arabs who professed it simply because it was alien to their style of life and did \nnot have the least relationship with their practical life",

The status of the woman among the nobility recorded an advanced \ndegree of esteem. The woman enjoyed a considerable portion of free will, and her \ndecision would most often be enforced. She was so highly cherished that blood would \nbe easily shed in defence of her honour. In fact, she was the most decisive key to \nbloody fight or friendly peace. These privileges notwithstanding, the family system in \nArabia was wholly patriarchal. The marriage contract rested completely in the hands \nof the woman’s legal guardian whose words with regard to her marital status could \nnever be questioned. \nOn the other hand, there were other social strata where prostitution and indecency \nwere rampant and in full operation. Abu Da’? , on the authority of ‘Aishah [R] \nreported four kinds of marriage in pre-Islamic Arabia: The first was similar to \npresent-day marriage procedures, in which case a man gives his daughter in \nmarriage to another man after a dowry has been agreed on. In the second, the \nhusband would send his wife – after the menstruation period – to cohabit with \nanother man in order to conceive. After conception her husband would, if he desired, \nhave a sexual intercourse with her. A third kind was that a group of less than ten \nmen would have sexual intercourse with a woman. If she conceived and gave birth to \na child, she would send for these men, and nobody could abstain. They would come \ntogether to her house. She would say: ‘You know what you have done. I have given \nbirth to a child and it is your child’ (pointing to one of them). The man meant would \nhave to accept. The fourth kind was that a lot of men would have sexual intercourse \nwith a certain woman (a whore). She would not prevent anybody. Such women used \nto put a certain flag at their gates to invite in anyone who liked. If this whore got \npregnant and gave birth to a child, she would collect those men, and a seeress would \ntell whose child it was. The appointed father would take the child and declare \nhim/her his own. When Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] declared Islam in Arabia, he \ncancelled all these forms of sexual contacts except that of present Islamic marriage. \n[Abu Da'ud - The Book of marriage] \nWomen always accompanied men in their wars.

He was also the first man who started Quraish’s two journeys of \nsummer and winter. It was reported that he went to Syria as a merchant. In \nMadinah, he married Salma — the daughter of ‘Amr from Bani ‘Adi bin An-\nNajjar. He spent some time with her in Madinah then he left for Syria again \nwhile she was pregnant.

When ‘Abdul-Muttalib \nreached the age of boyhood, his uncle Al-Muttalib heard of him and went to \nMadinah to fetch him. When he saw him, tears filled his eyes and rolled down \nhis cheeks, he embraced him and took him on his camel. The boy, however \nabstained from going with him to Makkah until he took his mother’s consent. \nAl-Muttalib asked her to send the boy with him to Makkah, but she refused. \nHe managed to convince her saying: \"Your son is going to Makkah to restore \nhis father’s authority, and to live in the vicinity of the Sacred House.\" There in \nMakkah, people wondered at seeing Abdul-Muttalib, and they considered him \nthe slave of Muttalib. Al-Muttalib said: \"He is my nephew, the son of my \nbrother Hashim.\" The boy was brought up in Al-Muttalib’s house, but later on \nAl-Muttalib died in Bardman in Yemen so ‘Abdul-Muttalib took over and \nmanaged to maintain his people’s prestige and outdo his grandfathers in his \nhonourable behaviour which gained him Makkah’s deep love and high esteem. \n[Ibn Hisham 1/137,138] \nWhen Al-Muttalib died, Nawfal usurped ‘Abdul-Muttalib of his charges, so the \nlatter asked for help from Quraish but they abstained from extending any sort \nof support to either of them. Consequently, he wrote to his uncles of Bani An-\nNajjar (his mother’s brothers) to come to his aid. His uncle, Abu Sa‘d bin ‘Adi \n(his mother’s brother) marched to Makkah at the head of eighty horsemen \nand camped in Abtah in Makkah. ‘Abdul-Muttalib received the men and invited \nthem to go to his house but Abu Sa‘d said: \"Not before I meet Nawfal.\" He \nfound Nawfal sitting with some old men of Quraish in the shade of Al-Ka‘bah. \nAbu Sa‘d drew his sword and said: \"I swear by All? that if you don’t restore \nto my nephew what you have taken, I will kill you with this sword.\" Nawfal \nwas thus forced to give up what he had usurped, and the notables of Quraish \nwere made to witness to his words. Abu Sa‘d then went to ‘Abdul-Muttalib’s \nhouse where he stayed for three nights, made ‘Umra and left back for \nMadinah. Later on, Nawfal entered into alliance with Bani ‘Abd Shams bin ‘Abd \nMunaf against Bani Hashim. When Khuza‘a, a tribe, saw Bani An-Najjar’s \nsupport to ‘Abdul-Muttalib they said: \"He is our son as he is yours.

His mother was \nFatimah, daughter of ‘Amr bin ‘A’idh bin ‘Imran bin Makhzum bin Yaqdha bin \nMurra. ‘Abdullah was the smartest of ‘Abdul-Muttalib’s sons, the chastest and \nthe most loved. He was also the son whom the divination arrows pointed at to \nbe slaughtered as a sacrifice to Al-Ka‘bah. When ‘Abdul-Muttalib had ten sons \nand they reached maturity, he divulged to them his secret vow in which they \nsilently and obediently acquiesced. Their names were written on divination \narrows and given to the guardian of their most beloved goddess, Hubal. The \narrows were shuffled and drawn. An arrow showed that it was ‘Abdullah to be \nsacrificed. ‘Abdul-Muttalib then took the boy to Al-Ka‘bah with a razor to \nslaughter the boy. Quraish, his uncles from Makhzum tribe and his brother \nAbu Talib, however, tried to dissuade him from consummating his purpose. \nHe then sought their advice as regards his vow. They suggested that he \nsummon a she-diviner to judge whereabout. She ordered that the divination \narrows should be drawn with respect to ‘Abdullah as well as ten camels. She \nadded that drawing the lots should be repeated with ten more camels every \ntime the arrow showed ‘Abdullah. The operation was thus repeated until the \nnumber of the camels amounted to one hundred. At this point the arrow \nshowed the camels, consequently they were all slaughtered (to the \nsatisfaction of Hubal) instead of his son. The slaughtered camels were left for \nanyone to eat from, human or animal. \nThis incident produced a change in the amount of blood-money usually \naccepted in Arabia. It had been ten camels, but after this event it was \nincreased to a hundred. Islam, later on, approved of this. Another thing \nclosely relevant to the above issue goes to the effect that the Prophet [pbuh] \nonce said: \n\"I am the offspring of the slaughtered two,\" meaning Ishmael and ‘Abdullah. \n[Ibn Hisham 1/151-155; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/89,90] \n‘Abdul-Muttalib chose Amina, daughter of Wahab bin ‘Abd Munaf bin Zahra bin \nKilab, as a wife for his son, ‘Abdullah.

They \nwere married in Makkah, and soon after ‘Abdullah was sent by his father to \nbuy dates in Madinah where he died. In another version, ‘Abdullah went to \nSyria on a trade journey and died in Madinah on his way back. He was buried \n\n36\nin the house of An-Nabigha Al-Ju‘di. He was twenty-five years old when he \ndied. Most historians state that his death was two months before the birth of \nMuhammad [pbuh] .

They \nwere married in Makkah, and soon after ‘Abdullah was sent by his father to \nbuy dates in Madinah where he died. In another version, ‘Abdullah went to \nSyria on a trade journey and died in Madinah on his way back. He was buried \n\n36\nin the house of An-Nabigha Al-Ju‘di. He was twenty-five years old when he \ndied. Most historians state that his death was two months before the birth of \nMuhammad [pbuh] . Some others said that his death was two months after \nthe Prophet’s birth. When Amina was informed of her husband’s death, she \ncelebrated his memory in a most heart-touching elegy.

    "content": "ophet [pbuh]. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 1/19] \nTraditions delightfully relate how Haleemah and the whole of her household were \nfavoured by successive strokes of good fortune while the baby Muhammad [pbuh] \nlived under her care. Ibn Ishaq states that Haleemah narrated that she along with \nher husband and a suckling babe, set out from her village in the company of some \nwomen of her clan in quest of children to suckle. She said: \nIt was a year of drought and famine and we had nothing to eat. I rode on a brown \nshe-ass. We also had with us an old she-camel. By All? we could not get even a \ndrop of milk. We could not have a wink of sleep during the night for the child kept \ncrying on account of hunger. There was not enough milk in my breast and even the \nshe-camel had nothing to feed him. We used to constantly pray for rain and \nimmediate relief. At length we reached Makkah looking for children to suckle. Not \neven a single woman amongst us accepted the Messenger of All? [pbuh] offered to \nher. As soon as they were told that he was an orphan, they refused him. We had \nfixed our eyes on the reward that we would get from the child’s father. An orphan! \nWhat are his grandfather and mother likely to do? So we spurned him because of \nthat. Every woman who came with me got a suckling and when we were about to \ndepart, I said to my husband: \"By All? , I do not like to go back along with the other \nwomen without any baby. I should go to that orphan and I must take him.\" He said, \n\"There is no harm in doing so and perhaps All? might bless us through him.\" So I \nwent and took him because there was simply no other alternative left for me but to \ntake him. When I lifted him in my arms and returned to my place I put him on my \nbreast and to my great surprise, I found enough milk in it. He drank to his heart’s \ncontent, and so did his foster brother and then both of them went to sleep although \nmy baby had not been able to sleep the previous night. My husband then went to the \nshe-camel to milk it and, to his astonishment, he found plenty of milk in it. He \nmilked it and we drank to our fill, and enjoyed a sound sleep during the night. The \nnext morning, my husband said: \"By All? Haleemah, you must understand that you \nhave been able to get a blessed child.\" And I replied: \"By the grace of All? , I hope \nso.\" \nThe tradition is explicit on the point that Haleemah’s return journey and her \nsubsequent life, as long as the Prophet [pbuh] stayed with her, was encircled with a \nhalo of good fortune. The donkey that she rode when she came to Makkah was lean \nand almost foundered; it recovered speed much to the amazement of Haleemah’s \nfellow travellers. By the time they reached the encampments in the country of the \nclan of Sa‘d, they found the scales of fortune turned in their favour. The barren land \nsprouted forth luxuriant grass and beasts came back to them satisfied and full of \nmilk. Muhammad [pbuh] stayed with Haleemah for two years until he was weaned as \nHaleemah said: \nWe then took him back to his mother requesting her earnestly to have him stay with \nus and benefit by the good fortune and blessings he had brought us. We persisted in \nour request which we substantiated by our anxiety over the child catching a certain \ninfection peculiar to Makkah.[Ibn Hisham 1/162-164] At last, we were granted our \nwish and the Prophet [pbuh] stayed with us until he was four or five years of age. \nWhen, as related by Anas in Sahih Muslim, Gabriel came down and ripped his chest \nopen and took out the heart. He then extracted a blood-clot out of it and said: \"That \n\n39\nwas the part of Satan in thee.\" And then he washed it with the water of Zamzam in a \ngold basin.

She set out to cover a journey of 500 kilometers with her orphan \nboy, woman servant Umm Ayman and her father-in-law ‘Abdul-Muttalib. She spent a \nmonth there and then took her way back to Makkah.

He had warm passions towards the boy, \nhis orphan grandson, whose recent disaster (his mother’s death) added more to the \npains of the past. ‘Abdul-Muttalib was more passionate with his grandson than with \nhis own children. He never left the boy a prey to loneliness, but always preferred him \nto his own kids. Ibn Hisham reported: A mattress was put in the shade of Al-Ka‘bah \nfor ‘Abdul-Muttalib. His children used to sit around that mattress in honour to their \nfather, but Muhammad [pbuh] used to sit on it. His uncles would take him back, but \nif ‘Abdul-Muttalib was present, he would say: \"Leave my grandson.

That was because it was a low building of white stones no more than 6.30 \nmetres high, from the days of Ishmael. It was also roofless and that gave the thieves \n\n42\neasy access to its treasures inside. It was also exposed to the wearing factors of \nnature — because it was built a long time ago — that weakened and cracked its \nwalls. Five years before Prophethood, there was a great flood in Makkah that swept \ntowards Al-Ka‘bah and almost demolished it. Quraish was obliged to rebuild it to \nsafeguard its holiness and position. The chiefs of Quraish decided to use only licit \nmoney in rebuilding Al-Ka‘bah, so all money that derived from harlotry, usury or \nunjust practices was excluded. They were, at first, too awed to knock down the wall, \nbut Al-Waleed bin Al-Mugheerah Al-Mukhzumi started the work. Seeing that no harm \nhad happened to him, the others participated in demolishing the walls until they \nreached the basis laid by Abraham. When they started rebuilding its walls, they \ndivided the work among the tribes. Each tribe was responsible for rebuilding a part of \nit. The tribes collected stones and started work. The man who laid the stones was a \nRoman mason called Baqum. The work went on in harmony till the time came to put \nthe sacred Black Stone in its proper place. Then strife broke out among the chiefs, \nand lasted for four or five days, each contesting for the honour of placing the stone \nin its position. Daggers were on the point of being drawn and great bloodshed \nseemed imminent. Luckily, the oldest among the chiefs Abu Omaiyah bin Mugheerah \nAl-Makhzumi made a proposal which was accepted by all. He said: \"Let him, who \nenters the Sanctuary first of all, decide on the point.\" It was then All? ’s Will that the \nMessenger of All? [pbuh] should be the first to enter the Mosque. On seeing him, all \nthe people on the scene, cried with one voice: \"Al-Ameen (the trustworthy) has \ncome. We are content to abide by his decision.\" Calm and self-possessed, \nMuhammad [pbuh] received the commission and at once resolved upon an expedient \nwhich was to conciliate them all. He asked for a mantle which he spread on the \nground and placed the stone in its centre. He then asked the representatives of the \ndifferent clans among them, to lift the stone all together. When it had reached the \nproper place, Muhammad [pbuh] laid it in the proper position with his own hands. \nThis is how a very tense situation was eased and a grave danger averted by the \nwisdom of the Prophet [pbuh]. \nQuraish ran short of the licit money, they collected, so they eliminated six yards area \non the northern side of Al-Ka‘bah which is called Al-Hijr or Al-Hateem. They raised its \ndoor two metres from the level ground to let in only the people whom they desired. \nWhen the structure was fifteen yards high they erected the roof which rested on six \ncolumns. \nWhen the building of Al-Ka‘bah had finished, it assumed a square form fifteen metres \nhigh. The side with the Black Stone and the one opposite were ten metres long each. \nThe Black Stone was 1.50 metre from the circumambulation level ground. The two \nother sides were twelve metres long each. The door was two metres high from the \nlevel ground. A building structure of 0.25 metre high and 0.30 metre wide on the \naverage surrounded Al-Ka‘bah. I",

He was an exemplary man of weighty mind and faultless insight. He was \nfavoured with intelligence, originality of thought and accurate choice of the means \nleading to accurate goals. His long silence helped favourably in his habit of \n\n43\nmeditation and deep investigation into the truth. His vivid mind and pure nature \nwere helpfully instrumental in assimilating and comprehending ways of life and \npeople, individual and community-wise. He shunned superstitious practices but took \nan active part in constructive and useful dealings, otherwise, he would have recourse \nto his self-consecrated solitude. He kept himself aloof from drinking wine, eating \nmeat slaughtered on stone altars, or attending idolatrous festivals. He held the idols \nin extreme aversion and most abhorrence. He could never tolerate someone \nswearing by Al-Lat and Al-‘Uzza. All? ’s providence, no doubts, detached him from all \nabominable or evil practices. Even when he tried to obey his instinct to enjoy some \nlife pleasures or follow some irrespectable traditions, All? ’s providence intervened to \ncurb any lapse in this course. Ibn Al-Atheer reported Muhammad [pbuh] as saying: \n\"I have never tried to do what my people do except for two times. Every time All?\n \nintervened and checked me from doing so and I never did that again. Once I told my \nfellow-shepherd to take care of my sheep when we were in the upper part of \nMakkah. I wanted to go down to Makkah and entertain myself as the young men did. \nI went down to the first house of Makkah where I heard music. I entered and asked: \n‘What is this?’ Someone answered: ‘It is a wedding party.’ I sat down and listened \nbut soon went into deep sleep. I was awakened by the heat of the sun. I went back \nto my fellow-shepherd and told him of what had happened to me. I have never tried \nit again.\" \nAl-Bukhari reported on the authority of Jabir bin ‘Abdullah that he said: \"While the \npeople were rebuilding Al-Ka‘bah, the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] went with ‘Abbas \nto carry some stones. ‘Abbas said: ‘Put your loincloth round your neck to protect you \nfrom the stones.’ (As he did that) the Prophet [pbuh] fell to the ground and his eyes \nturned skyward. Later on he woke up and shouted: ‘My loincloth... my loincloth.’ He \nwrapped himself in his loincloth.\" In another report: \"His loins were never seen \nafterwards.\" [Bukhari Chapter: The Building of Al-Ka'bah, 1/540] \nThe authorities agree in ascribing to the youth of Muhammad [pbuh] modesty of \ndeportment, virtuous behaviour and graceful manners. He proved himself to be the \nideal of manhood, and to possess a spotless character. He was the most obliging to \nhis compatriots, the most honest in his talk and the mildest in temper. He was the \nmost gentle-hearted, chaste, hospitable and always impressed people by his piety-\ninspiring countenance. He was the most truthful and the best to keep covenant. His \nfellow-citizens, by common consent, gave him the title of Al-‘Ameen (trustworthy). \nThe Mother of believers, Khadijah [R], once said: He unites uterine relations, he \nhelps the poor and the needy, he entertains the guests and endures hardships in the \npath of truth",

May \nAll? reward him, for us and all humanity, the best ending. The following research at \nhand gives an account in miniature of his long strive and uninterrupted struggle he \nmade after receiving the ministry of Messengership. [Fi Zilal Al-Qur'an 29/168-\n171,182] \n\n49\nPhases and Stages of the Call \nThe Muhammadan Call could be divided into two phases distinctively demarcated: \n1. The Makkan phase: nearly thirteen years. \n2. The Madinese phase: fully ten years. \nEach of the two phases included distinctive features easily discernible through \naccurate scrutiny into the circumstances that characterized each of them. \nThe Makkan phase can be divided into three stages: \n1. The stage of the secret Call: three years. \n2. The stage of the proclamation of the Call in Makkah: from the beginning of \nthe fourth year of Prophethood to almost the end of the tenth year. \n3. The stage of the call to Islam and propagating it beyond Makkah: it lasted \nfrom the end of tenth year of the Prophethood until Muhammad’s [pbuh] \nemigration to Madinah. \nThe Madinese phase will be considered later in its due course. \nThe First Stage : Strife in the Way of the Call \nThree Years of Secret Call \nIt is well-known that Makkah was the centre for the Arabs, and housed the \ncustodians of Al-Ka‘bah. Protection and guardianship of the idols and stone graven \nimages that received veneration on the part of all the Arabs lay in the hands of the \nMakkans. Hence the difficulty of hitting the target of reform and rectitude in a place \nconsidered the den of idolatry. Working in such an atmosphere no doubt requires \nunshakable will and determination, that is why the call unto Islam assumed a \nclandestine form so that the Makkans should not be enraged by the unexpected \nsurprise. \nThe Early Converts \nThe Prophet [pbuh] naturally initiated his sacred mission right from home and then \nmoved to the people closely associated with him. He called unto Islam whomsoever \nhe thought would attest the truth which had come from his Lord. In fact, a host of \npeople who nursed not the least seed of doubt as regards the Prophet [pbuh], \nimmediately responded and quite readily embraced the true faith. They are known in \nthe Islamic literature as the early converts. \nKhadijah, the Prophet’s spouse, the mother of believers, was the first to enter the \nfold of Islam followed by his freed slave Zaid bin Harithah, his cousin, ‘Ali bin Abi \nTalib, who had been living with him since his early childhood, and next came his \nintimate friend Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (Abu Bakr the truth verifier). All of those \nprofessed Islam on the very first day of the call. [Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/50] Abu \nBakr, and from the first day he embraced Islam, proved to be an energetic and most \n\n50\nzealous activist. He was wealthy, obliging, mild and upright. People used to frequent \nhis house and draw nigh to him for his knowledge, amity, pleasant company and \nbusiness. He invited whomever he had confidence in to Islam and through his \npersonal efforts a good number of people converted to Islam, such as ‘Uthman bin \n‘Affan Al-Umawi, Az-Zubair bin ‘Awwam Al-Asadi, ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf, Sa‘d bin \nAbi Waqqas, Az-Zuhri and Talhah bin ‘Ubaidullah At-Tamimy. Those eight men \nconstituted the forerunners and more specifically the vanguard of the new faith in \nArabia. Among the early Muslim were Bilal bin Rabah (the Abyssinian), Abu ‘Ubaidah \nbin Al-Jarrah from Bani Harith bin Fahr (the most trustworthy of the Muslim Nation), \nAbu Salamah bin ‘Abd Al-Asad, Al-Arqam bin Abi Al-Arqam from the tribe of \nMakhzum, ‘Uthman bin Maz‘oun and his two brothers Qudama and ‘Abdullah, \n‘Ubaidah bin Al-Harith bin Al-Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf, Sa‘id bin Zaid Al-‘Adawi and \nhis wife Fatimah - daughter of Al-Khattab (the sister of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab), \nKhabbab bin Al-Aratt, ‘Abdull? bin Mas‘ud Al-Hadhali and many others. These were \nthe Muslim predecessors. They belonged to various septs of Quraish. Ibn Hisham, a \nbiographer, counted them to be more than forty. [Ibn Hisham 1/245-262] \nIbn Ishaq said: \"Then people entered the fold of Islam in hosts, men or women and \nthe new faith could no longer be kept secret.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/262] \nThe Prophet [pbuh] used to meet and teach, the new converts, the religion in privacy \nbecause the call to Islam was still running on an individual and secret basis. \nRevelation accelerated and continued after the first verses of \"O you wrapped in \ngarments.\" The verses and pieces of S? ah (chapters) revealed at this time were \nshort ones with wonderful strong pauses and quite fascinating rhythms in full \nharmony with that delicate whispering setting. The central topic running through \nthem focused on sanctifying the soul, and deterring the Muslims from falling prey to \nthe deceptive glamour of life. The early verses used as well to give a highly accurate \naccount of the Hell and the Garden (Paradise), leading the believers down a new \ncourse diametrically opposed to the ill practices rampant amongst their compatriots. \nAs-Sal? (the Prayer) \nMuqatil bin Sulaiman said: \"Sal? (prayer) was established as an obligatory ritual at \nan early stage of the Islamic Call, a two rak‘ ah (unit of prayer) Sal? in the morning \nand the same in the evening: \n\"And glorify the praises of your Lord in the ‘Ashi (i.e. the time period after \nthe mid-noon till sunset) and in the Ibkar (i.e. the time period from early \nmorning or sunrise till before mid-noon).\" [Al-Qur'an 40:55] \nIbn Hijr said: \"Definitely the Prophet [pbuh] used to pray before ‘The Night Journey’ \nbut it still remains a matter of controversy whether or not the prayer was established \nas an obligatory ritual before imposing the rules of the usual five prayers a day. It is \nrelated that obligatory prayer was established twice a day, in the morning before \nsunrise and after sunset. It is reported through a chain of narrators that when the \nProphet [pbuh] received the first Revelation, Gabriel - the angel, proceeded and \ntaught him how to observe Wudu (ablution). When the Prophet [pbuh] had finished, \nhe took a handful of water and sprinkled it on his loins. [Mukhtasar Seerat-ur-Rasool \np.88] \n\n51\nIbn Hisham reported that when it was time for prayers, the Messenger of All?\n \n[pbuh] and his Companions went into a mountain valley to pray secretly. Abu Talib \nonce saw the Messenger of All? [pbuh] and Ali praying, he asked them what they \nwere up to. When he got to know that it was obligatory prayer, he told them to stay \nconstant in their practice. [Ibn Hisham 1/247] \nThe Quraishites learn about the Call \nThis stage of the Call, even though conducted in a clandestine manner and on an \nindividual basis, its news leaked out and assumed a public interest all over Makkah. \nIn the beginning, the Makkan leaders did not care much about Muhammad \n[pbuh]and took no heed of his teachings. At first, they thought that Muhammad \n[pbuh] was merely a religious philosophist like Omaiyah bin Abi As-Salt, Quss bin \nSa‘idah, ‘Amr bin Nufail and their ilk who used to philosophize on godship and \nreligious obligations. But this attitude of indifference soon changed into real \napprehension. The polytheists of Quraish began to watch Muhammad’s movements \nclosely and anxiously for fear of spreading his Call and producing a change in the \nprevalent mentality. [Fiqh As-Seerah p.76] \nFor three underground years of activism, a group of believers emerged stamped by a \nspirit of fraternity and cooperation with one definite objective in their mind: \npropagating and deeply establishing the call unto Islam. For full three years \nMuhammad [pbuh] had been content to t",

Among the early Muslim were Bilal bin Rabah (the Abyssinian), Abu ‘Ubaidah \nbin Al-Jarrah from Bani Harith bin Fahr (the most trustworthy of the Muslim Nation), \nAbu Salamah bin ‘Abd Al-Asad, Al-Arqam bin Abi Al-Arqam from the tribe of \nMakhzum, ‘Uthman bin Maz‘oun and his two brothers Qudama and ‘Abdullah, \n‘Ubaidah bin Al-Harith bin Al-Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf, Sa‘id bin Zaid Al-‘Adawi and \nhis wife Fatimah - daughter of Al-Khattab (the sister of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab), \nKhabbab bin Al-Aratt, ‘Abdull? bin Mas‘ud Al-Hadhali and many others. These were \nthe Muslim predecessors. They belonged to various septs of Quraish. Ibn Hisham, a \nbiographer, counted them to be more than forty. [Ibn Hisham 1/245-262] \nIbn Ishaq said: \"Then people entered the fold of Islam in hosts, men or women and \nthe new faith could no longer be kept secret.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/262] \nThe Prophet [pbuh] used to meet and teach, the new converts, the religion in privacy \nbecause the call to Islam was still running on an individual and secret basis. \nRevelation accelerated and continued after the first verses of \"O you wrapped in \ngarments.\" The verses and pieces of S? ah (chapters) revealed at this time were \nshort ones with wonderful strong pauses and quite fascinating rhythms in full \nharmony with that delicate whispering setting. The central topic running through \nthem focused on sanctifying the soul, and deterring the Muslims from falling prey to \nthe deceptive glamour of life. The early verses used as well to give a highly accurate \naccount of the Hell and the Garden (Paradise), leading the believers down a new \ncourse diametrically opposed to the ill practices rampant amongst their compatriots. \nAs-Sal? (the Prayer) \nMuqatil bin Sulaiman said: \"Sal? (prayer) was established as an obligatory ritual at \nan early stage of the Islamic Call, a two rak‘ ah (unit of prayer) Sal? in the morning \nand the same in the evening: \n\"And glorify the praises of your Lord in the ‘Ashi (i.e. the time period after \nthe mid-noon till sunset) and in the Ibkar (i.e. the time period from early \nmorning or sunrise till before mid-noon).\" [Al-Qur'an 40:55] \nIbn Hijr said: \"Definitely the Prophet [pbuh] used to pray before ‘The Night Journey’ \nbut it still remains a matter of controversy whether or not the prayer was established \nas an obligatory ritual before imposing the rules of the usual five prayers a day. It is \nrelated that obligatory prayer was established twice a day, in the morning before \nsunrise and after sunset. It is reported through a chain of narrators that when the \nProphet [pbuh] received the first Revelation, Gabriel - the angel, proceeded and \ntaught him how to observe Wudu (ablution). When the Prophet [pbuh] had finished, \nhe took a handful of water and sprinkled it on his loins. [Mukhtasar Seerat-ur-Rasool \np.88] \n\n51\nIbn Hisham reported that when it was time for prayers, the Messenger of All?\n \n[pbuh] and his Companions went into a mountain valley to pray secretly. Abu Talib \nonce saw the Messenger of All? [pbuh] and Ali praying, he asked them what they \nwere up to. When he got to know that it was obligatory prayer, he told them to stay \nconstant in their practice. [Ibn Hisham 1/247] \nThe Quraishites learn about the Call \nThis stage of the Call, even though conducted in a clandestine manner and on an \nindividual basis, its news leaked out and assumed a public interest all over Makkah. \nIn the beginning, the Makkan leaders did not care much about Muhammad \n[pbuh]and took no heed of his teachings. At first, they thought that Muhammad \n[pbuh] was merely a religious philosophist like Omaiyah bin Abi As-Salt, Quss bin \nSa‘idah, ‘Amr bin Nufail and their ilk who used to philosophize on godship and \nreligious obligations. But this attitude of indifference soon changed into real \napprehension. The polytheists of Quraish began to watch Muhammad’s movements \nclosely and anxiously for fear of spreading his Call and producing a change in the \nprevalent mentality. [Fiqh As-Seerah p.76] \nFor three underground years of activism, a group of believers emerged stamped by a \nspirit of fraternity and cooperation with one definite objective in their mind: \npropagating and deeply establishing the call unto Islam. For full three years \nMuhammad [pbuh] had been content to t",

    "content": "and crush down their idolatrous practices. \n\n52\nThe Second Phase: Open Preaching \nFirst Revelation regarding the Preaching \n\"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred.\" [Al-Qur'an 26:214]. \nThis was the first verse to be revealed in this concern. It is included in S? ah Ash-\nShu‘ar?/i> (Chapter 26 – The Poets) which relates the story of Moses [AWS] from his \nearly days of Prophethood going through his migration with the Children of Israel, \ntheir escape from the Pharaoh and his folk, and the drowning Pharaoh and his hosts. \nThis Chapter in fact narrates the different stages that Moses [AWS] passed through \nin his struggle with Pharaoh and the mission of calling his people unto All? . \nMoreover, it includes stories that speak about the terrible end in store for those who \nbelied the Messengers such as the people of Noah, ‘Ad, Thamud, Abraham, Lout and \nAhlul-Aikah (Companions of the Wood). (A group of people who used to worship a \ntree called Aikah) \nChronologically, this Chapter belongs to the middle Makkan period, when the contact \nof the light of Prophecy with the cultural milieu of pagan Makkah was testing the \nMakkans in their most arrogant mood. The Message that this Chapter communicates \nis in brief: \"The Truth is insurmountable. When the spirit of Prophecy came to \nMakkah, it was resisted by the votaries of evil; but Truth, unlike falsehood, is bound \nto stay, whereas falsehood is surely perishable.\" \nCalling the Closest Kinspeople \nIn obedience to All? ’s Commands, Muhammad [pbuh] rallied his kinsmen of Bani \nHashim with a group of Bani Al-Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf. The audience counted forty-\nfive men. \nAbu Lahab immediately took the initiative and addressed the Prophet [pbuh]: \"These \nare your uncles and cousins, speak on to the point, but first of all you have got to \nknow that your kinspeople are not in a position to withstand all the Arabs. Another \npoint you have got to bear in mind is that your relatives are sufficient unto you.

Verily, I have never heard of anyone who has \nincurred more harm on his kinspeople than you.\" The Messenger of All? [pbuh] kept \nsilent and said nothing in that meeting. \nHe invited them to another meeting and managed to secure audience. He then stood \nup and delivered a short speech explaining quite cogently what was at stake. He \nsaid: \"I celebrate All? ’s praise, I seek His help, I believe in Him, I put my trust in \nHim, I bear witness that there is no god to be worshipped but All? with no associate. \nA guide can never lie to his people. I swear by All? , there is no god but He, that I \nhave been sent as a Messenger to you, in particular and to all the people, in general. \nI swear by All? you will die just as you sleep, you will be resurrected just as you \nwake up. You will be called to account for your deeds.

It is included in S? ah Ash-\nShu‘ar?/i> (Chapter 26 – The Poets) which relates the story of Moses [AWS] from his \nearly days of Prophethood going through his migration with the Children of Israel, \ntheir escape from the Pharaoh and his folk, and the drowning Pharaoh and his hosts. \nThis Chapter in fact narrates the different stages that Moses [AWS] passed through \nin his struggle with Pharaoh and the mission of calling his people unto All? . \nMoreover, it includes stories that speak about the terrible end in store for those who \nbelied the Messengers such as the people of Noah, ‘Ad, Thamud, Abraham, Lout and \nAhlul-Aikah (Companions of the Wood). (A group of people who used to worship a \ntree called Aikah) \nChronologically, this Chapter belongs to the middle Makkan period, when the contact \nof the light of Prophecy with the cultural milieu of pagan Makkah was testing the \nMakkans in their most arrogant mood. The Message that this Chapter communicates \nis in brief: \"The Truth is insurmountable. When the spirit of Prophecy came to \nMakkah, it was resisted by the votaries of evil; but Truth, unlike falsehood, is bound \nto stay, whereas falsehood is surely perishable.\" \nCalling the Closest Kinspeople \nIn obedience to All? ’s Commands, Muhammad [pbuh] rallied his kinsmen of Bani \nHashim with a group of Bani Al-Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf. The audience counted forty-\nfive men. \nAbu Lahab immediately took the initiative and addressed the Prophet [pbuh]: \"These \nare your uncles and cousins, speak on to the point, but first of all you have got to \nknow that your kinspeople are not in a position to withstand all the Arabs. Another \npoint you have got to bear in mind is that your relatives are sufficient unto you. If \nyou follow their tradition, it will be easier for them than to face the other clans of \nQuraish supported by the other Arabs. Verily, I have never heard of anyone who has \nincurred more harm on his kinspeople than you.\" The Messenger of All?

    "content": "accept his Call. [At-Tirmidhi; Masud Ahmad, 3/492,4/341] \n Attempts made to check the Onward March of Islam \nHaving fully perceived that Muhammad [pbuh] could never be desisted from his Call, \nQuraish, in a desperate attempt to quell the tidal wave of the Call, resorted to other \ncheap means acting from base motives: \n\n56\n1. Scoffing, degrading, ridiculing, belying and laughter-instigating cheap \nmanners, all of which levelled at the new converts in general, and the person \nof Muhammad [pbuh] in particular, with the aim of dragging the spirit of \ndespair into their morale, and slackening their ardent zealotry. They used to \ndenounce the Prophet [pbuh] as a man possessed by a jinn, or an insane \nperson: \n\"And they say: O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) to whom the Dhikr (the Qur’? ) \nhas been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man.\" [Al-Qur'an 15:6] \nor a liar practising witchcraft, \n\"And they (Arab pagans) wonder that a warner (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) \nhas come to them from among themselves! And the disbelievers say: \"This \n(Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) is a sorcerer, a liar.\" [Al-Qur'an 38:4]. \nTheir eyes would also look at the good man as if they would ‘eat him up’, or \ntrip him up, or disturb him from the position of stability or firmness. They \nused all sorts of terms of abuse ‘madman’ or ‘one possessed by an evil spirit’, \nand so on: \n\"And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes \nthrough hatreds when they hear the Reminder (the Qur’? ), and they say: \nVerily, he (Muhammad [pbuh]) is a madman!\" [Al-Qur'an 68:51] \nAmongst the early converts, there was a group who had unfortunately no \nstrong clan at their back to support them. These innocent souls were ridiculed \nand jeered in season and out of season. Referring to such people, the \nhighbrow Quraish aristocrats used repeatedly to ask the Prophet [pbuh], with \njest and scorn: \n\"All? has favoured from amongst us?\" [Al-Qur'an 6:53] \nAnd All? said: \n\"Does not All? know best those who are grateful?\" [Al-Qur'an 6:53] \nThe wicked used to laugh at the righteous in many ways: \na. They would inwardly laugh at their Faith, because they felt themselves \nso superior. \nb. In public places, when the righteous passed, they used to insult and \nwink at them, \nc. In their own houses, they would run them down. \nd. Whenever and wherever they saw them, they reproached and called \nthem fools who had lost their way. In the Hereafter, all these tricks \nand falsehoods will be shown for what they are, and the tables will be \nreversed. All? had said: \n\n57\n\"Verily! (During the worldly life) those who committed crimes used to laugh at \nthose who believed; and whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to \nanother (in mockery); and when they returned to their own people, they \nwould return jesting; and when they saw them, they said: ‘Verily! These have \nindeed gone astry!’ But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as \nwatchers over them (the believers).\" [Al-Qur'an 83:29-33] \n2. Distorting Muhammad’s teachings, evoking ambiguities, circulating false \npropaganda; forging groundless allegations concerning his doctrines, person \nand character, and going to excess in such a manner in order to screen off \nany scope of sound contemplation from the public. With respect to the Qur’? , \nthey used to allege that it was: \n\"Tales of the ancients, which he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has written down, and \nthey are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\" [Al-Qur'an 25:5] \nThe iniquitous went on ceaselessly inculcating in people’s ears that the Qur’?\n \nwas not a true Revelation: \n\"This (the Qur’? ) is nothing but a lie that he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has \ninvented, and others have helped him at it.\" [Al-Qur'an 25:4] \nThe wicked would also attribute to men of All? just such motives and springs \nof action as they themselves would be guilty of in such circumstances. The \npagans and those who were hostile to the revelation of All? and Islam, could \nnot understand how such wonderful verses could flow from the tongue of the \nProphet [pbuh] without having someone to teach, and claimed: \n\"It is only a human being who teaches him.\" [Al-Qur'an 16:103] \nThey also raised another baseless and superficial objection: \n\"Why does this Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) eat food and walk about in \nthe markets (like ourselves)?\" [Al-Qur'an 25:7] \nThey were sadly ignorant and painfully at fault for they could not perceive \nthat a teacher for mankind is one who shares their nature, mingles in their \nlife, is acquainted with their doings, and sympathises with their joys and \nsorrows. \nThe Noble Qur’? has vehemently refuted their charges and allegations and \nhas explained that the utterances of the Prophet [pbuh] are the Revelations \nof the Lord and their nature and contents provide a bold challenge to those \nwho attribute his Prophetic expressions to some base origin, at times to the \nmental throes of a dreaming reformer, at others to the",

Scoffing, degrading, ridiculing, belying and laughter-instigating cheap \nmanners, all of which levelled at the new converts in general, and the person \nof Muhammad [pbuh] in particular, with the aim of dragging the spirit of \ndespair into their morale, and slackening their ardent zealotry. They used to \ndenounce the Prophet [pbuh] as a man possessed by a jinn, or an insane \nperson: \n\"And they say: O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) to whom the Dhikr (the Qur’? ) \nhas been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man.\" [Al-Qur'an 15:6] \nor a liar practising witchcraft, \n\"And they (Arab pagans) wonder that a warner (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) \nhas come to them from among themselves! And the disbelievers say: \"This \n(Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) is a sorcerer, a liar.\" [Al-Qur'an 38:4]. \nTheir eyes would also look at the good man as if they would ‘eat him up’, or \ntrip him up, or disturb him from the position of stability or firmness. They \nused all sorts of terms of abuse ‘madman’ or ‘one possessed by an evil spirit’, \nand so on: \n\"And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes \nthrough hatreds when they hear the Reminder (the Qur’? ), and they say: \nVerily, he (Muhammad [pbuh]) is a madman!\" [Al-Qur'an 68:51] \nAmongst the early converts, there was a group who had unfortunately no \nstrong clan at their back to support them. These innocent souls were ridiculed \nand jeered in season and out of season. Referring to such people, the \nhighbrow Quraish aristocrats used repeatedly to ask the Prophet [pbuh], with \njest and scorn: \n\"All? has favoured from amongst us?\" [Al-Qur'an 6:53] \nAnd All? said: \n\"Does not All? know best those who are grateful?\" [Al-Qur'an 6:53] \nThe wicked used to laugh at the righteous in many ways: \na. They would inwardly laugh at their Faith, because they felt themselves \nso superior. \nb. In public places, when the righteous passed, they used to insult and \nwink at them, \nc. In their own houses, they would run them down. \nd. Whenever and wherever they saw them, they reproached and called \nthem fools who had lost their way. In the Hereafter, all these tricks \nand falsehoods will be shown for what they are, and the tables will be \nreversed. All? had said: \n\n57\n\"Verily! (During the worldly life) those who committed crimes used to laugh at \nthose who believed; and whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to \nanother (in mockery); and when they returned to their own people, they \nwould return jesting; and when they saw them, they said: ‘Verily! These have \nindeed gone astry!’ But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as \nwatchers over them (the believers).\" [Al-Qur'an 83:29-33] \n2. Distorting Muhammad’s teachings, evoking ambiguities, circulating false \npropaganda; forging groundless allegations concerning his doctrines, person \nand character, and going to excess in such a manner in order to screen off \nany scope of sound contemplation from the public. With respect to the Qur’? , \nthey used to allege that it was: \n\"Tales of the ancients, which he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has written down, and \nthey are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\" [Al-Qur'an 25:5] \nThe iniquitous went on ceaselessly inculcating in people’s ears that the Qur’?\n \nwas not a true Revelation: \n\"This (the Qur’? ) is nothing but a lie that he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has \ninvented, and others have helped him at it.\" [Al-Qur'an 25:4] \nThe wicked would also attribute to men of All? just such motives and springs \nof action as they themselves would be guilty of in such circumstances. The \npagans and those who were hostile to the revelation of All? and Islam, could \nnot understand how such wonderful verses could flow from the tongue of the \nProphet [pbuh] without having someone to teach, and claimed: \n\"It is only a human being who teaches him.\" [Al-Qur'an 16:103] \nThey also raised another baseless and superficial objection: \n\"Why does this Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) eat food and walk about in \nthe markets (like ourselves)?\" [Al-Qur'an 25:7] \nThey were sadly ignorant and painfully at fault for they could not perceive \nthat a teacher for mankind is one who shares their nature, mingles in their \nlife, is acquainted with their doings, and sympathises with their joys and \nsorrows. \nThe Noble Qur’? has vehemently refuted their charges and allegations and \nhas explained that the utterances of the Prophet [pbuh] are the Revelations \nof the Lord and their nature and contents provide a bold challenge to those \nwho attribute his Prophetic expressions to some base origin, at times to the \nmental throes of a dreaming reformer, at others to the",

    "content": "sly and put him to \nunspeakable tortures. [Ibn Hisham 1/320] \nThe uncle of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan used to wrap ‘Uthman in a mat of palm leaves, and \nset fire under him. When Umm Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair heard of her son’s conversion, she \nput him to starvation and then expelled him from her house. He used to enjoy full \nluxurious easy life, but in the aftermath of the tortures he sustained, his skin got \nwizened, and he assumed a horrible physical appearance. [Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen \n1/57; Talqeeh Ahl-al-Athar p.60] \nBilal, the slave of Omaiyah bin Khalaf, was severely beaten by his master when the \nlatter came to know of his conversion to Islam. Sometimes a rope was put around \nhis neck and street boys were made to drag him through the streets and even across \nthe hillocks of Makkah. At times he was subjected to prolonged deprivation of food \nand drink; at others he was bound up, made to lie down on the burning sand and \nunder the crushing burden of heavy stones. Similar other measures were resorted to \nin order to force him to recant. All this proved in vain. He persisted in his belief in \nthe Oneness of All? . On one such occasion, Abu Bakr was passing by; moved by \npity, he purchased and emancipated him from slavery. [Ibn Hisham 1/317-318; \nRahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/57] \nAnother victim of the highhandedness of Quraish was ‘Ammar bin Yasir, a freed slave \nof Bani Makhzoum. He, along with his mother and father, embraced Islam in its early \n\n62\nphase. They were repeatedly made to lie on the burning sand and were beaten \nseverely. ‘Ammar was at times tossed up on embers. The Prophet [pbuh] was greatly \nmoved by the atrocities which were being perpetrated upon ‘Ammar and his family. \nHe always comforted them and raised his hand in prayer and said: \"Be patient, you \nwill verily find your abode in the Paradise.\" Yasir, the father, died because of \nrepeated tortures. Sumaiyah, ‘Ammar’s mother was bayoneted to death by Abu Jahl \nhimself, and thus merited the title of the first woman martyr in Islam. ‘Ammar \nhimself was subjected to various modes of torture and was always threatened to \nsustain severe suffering unless he abused Muhammad [pbuh] and recanted to Al-Lat \nand ‘Uzza. In a weak moment, he uttered a word construed as recantation though \nhis heart never wavered and he came back once to the Prophet [pbuh] , who \nconsoled him for his pain and confirmed his faith.

    "enhanced_text": "sly and put him to \nunspeakable tortures. [Ibn Hisham 1/320] \nThe uncle of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan used to wrap ‘Uthman in a mat of palm leaves, and \nset fire under him. When Umm Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair heard of her son’s conversion, she \nput him to starvation and then expelled him from her house. He used to enjoy full \nluxurious easy life, but in the aftermath of the tortures he sustained, his skin got \nwizened, and he assumed a horrible physical appearance. [Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen \n1/57; Talqeeh Ahl-al-Athar p.60] \nBilal, the slave of Omaiyah bin Khalaf, was severely beaten by his master when the \nlatter came to know of his conversion to Islam. Sometimes a rope was put around \nhis neck and street boys were made to drag him through the streets and even across \nthe hillocks of Makkah. At times he was subjected to prolonged deprivation of food \nand drink; at others he was bound up, made to lie down on the burning sand and \nunder the crushing burden of heavy stones. Similar other measures were resorted to \nin order to force him to recant. All this proved in vain. He persisted in his belief in \nthe Oneness of All? . On one such occasion, Abu Bakr was passing by; moved by \npity, he purchased and emancipated him from slavery. [Ibn Hisham 1/317-318; \nRahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/57] \nAnother victim of the highhandedness of Quraish was ‘Ammar bin Yasir, a freed slave \nof Bani Makhzoum. He, along with his mother and father, embraced Islam in its early \n\n62\nphase. They were repeatedly made to lie on the burning sand and were beaten \nseverely. ‘Ammar was at times tossed up on embers. The Prophet [pbuh] was greatly \nmoved by the atrocities which were being perpetrated upon ‘Ammar and his family. \nHe always comforted them and raised his hand in prayer and said: \"Be patient, you \nwill verily find your abode in the Paradise.\" Yasir, the father, died because of \nrepeated tortures. Sumaiyah, ‘Ammar’s mother was bayoneted to death by Abu Jahl \nhimself, and thus merited the title of the first woman martyr in Islam. ‘Ammar \nhimself was subjected to various modes of torture and was always threatened to \nsustain severe suffering unless he abused Muhammad [pbuh] and recanted to Al-Lat \nand ‘Uzza.

He took the \ndecision to meet them secretly lest Quraish should get to know of his designs, and so \ntake measures that might foil his goals. He also had in mind to avoid any sort of \nopen confrontation with the polytheists because such a thing at this early stage \nwould not be in the interest of the newly-born Call, still vulnerable and not fully \nfledged. Once, in the fourth year of Prophethood, the Muslims were on their way to \nthe hillocks of Makkah to hold a clandestine meeting with the Prophet [pbuh], when \na group of polytheists did observe their suspicious movement and began to abuse \nand fight them.

[Ibn Hisham 1/263] \n\n63\nThe Prophet [pbuh], on the other hand, used to proclaim the Islamic Faith and \npreach it openly with deep devotion and studious pursuit, but for the general welfare \nof the new converts and in consideration of the strategic interest of Islam, he took \nDar Al-Arqam, in As-Safa mountain, in the fifth year of his mission, as a temporary \ncentre to meet his followers secretly and instruct them in the Qur’? and in the \nIslamic wisdom. \nThe First Migration to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) \nThe series of persecutions started late in the fourth year of Prophethood, slowly at \nfirst, but steadily accelerated and worsened day by day and month by month until \nthe situation got so extremely grave and no longer tolerable in the middle of the fifth \nyear, that the Muslims began to seriously think of feasible ways liable to avert the \npainful tortures meted out to them. It was at that gloomy and desperate time that \nS? ah Al-Kahf (Chapter 18 — The Cave) was revealed comprising definite answers to \nthe questions with which the polytheists of Makkah constantly pestered the Prophet \n[pbuh] . It comprises three stories that include highly suggestive parables for the \ntrue believers to assimilate. The story of the Companions of the Cave implies implicit \nguidance for the believers to evacuate the hot spots of disbelief and aggression \npregnant with the peril of enticement away from the true religion: \n\"(The young men said to one another): \"And when you withdraw from them, and \nthat which they worship, except All? , then seek refuge in the Cave, your Lord will \nopen a way for you from His Mercy and will make easy for you your affair (i.e. will \ngive you what you will need of provision, dwelling, etc.)\" [Al-Qur'an 18:16]. \nNext, there is the story of Al-Khidr (The Teacher of Arabia) and Moses [AWS] in a \nclear and delicate reference to the vicissitudes of life. Future circumstances of life are \nnot necessarily the products of the prevalent conditions, they might be categorically \nthe opposite. In other words, the war waged against the Muslims would in the future \nassume a different turn, and the tyrannous oppressors would one day come to suffer \nand be subjected to the same tortures to which the Muslims were then put. \nFurthermore, there is the story of Dhul-Qarnain (The Two Horned One), the powerful \nruler of west and east.

It also speaks that All? raises a \nrighteous man every now and then to protect the weak against the strong. \nS? ah Az-Zumar (Chapter 39 — The Crowds) was then revealed pointing directly to \nmigration and stating that the earth is spacious enough and the believers must not \nconsider themselves constrained by the forces of tyranny and evil: \n\"Good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world, and All? ’s earth is \nspacious (so if you cannot worship All? at a place, then go to another)!

They were ‘Amr bin Al-‘As and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Rabi‘a — before \nembracing Islam. They had taken with them valuable gifts to the king and his clergy, \nand had been able to win some of the courtiers over to their side. The pagan envoys \nclaimed that the Muslim refugees should be expelled from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and \nmade over to them, on the ground that they had abandoned the religion of their \nforefathers, and their leader was preaching a religion different from theirs and from \nthat of the king. \nThe king summoned the Muslims to the court and asked them to explain the \nteachings of their religion. The Muslim emigrants had decided to tell the whole truth \nwhatever the consequences were. Ja‘far bin Abi Talib stood up and addressed the \nking in the following words: \"O king! we were plunged in the depth of ignorance and \nbarbarism; we adored idols, we lived in unchastity, we ate the dead bodies, and we \nspoke abominations, we disregarded every feeling of humanity, and the duties of \nhospitality and neighbourhood were neglected; we knew no law but that of the \nstrong, when All? raised among us a man, of whose birth, truthfulness, honesty, \nand purity we were aware; and he called to the Oneness of All? , and taught us not \nto associate anything with Him. He forbade us the worship of idols; and he enjoined \nus to speak the truth, to be faithful to our trusts, to be merciful and to regard the \nrights of the neighbours and kith and kin; he forbade us to speak evil of women, or \nto eat the substance of orphans; he ordered us to fly from the vices, and to abstain \nfrom evil; to offer prayers, to render alms, and to observe fast. We have believed in \nhim, we have accepted his teachings and his injunctions to worship All? , and not to \nassociate anything with Him, and we have allowed what He has allowed, and \nprohibited what He has prohibited. For this reason, our people have risen against us, \nhave persecuted us in order to make us forsake the worship of All? and return to \nthe worship of idols and other abominations. They have tortured and injured us, until \nfinding no safety among them, we have come to your country, and hope you will \nprotect us from oppression.\" \n\n66\nThe king was very much impressed by these words and asked the Muslims to recite \nsome of All? ’s Revelation. Ja‘far recited the opening verses of S? ah Maryam \n(Chapter 19 — Mary) wherein is told the story of the birth of both John and Jesus \nChrist, down to the account of Mary having been fed with the food miraculously. \nThereupon the king, along with the bishops of his realm, was moved to tears that \nrolled down his cheeks and even wet his beard. Here, the Negus exclaimed: \"It \nseems as if these words and those which were revealed to Jesus are the rays of the \nlight which have radiated from the same source.\" Turning to the crest-fallen envoys \nof Quraish, he said, \"I am afraid, I cannot give you back these refugees. They are \nfree to live and worship in my realm as they please.\" \nOn the morrow, the two envoys again went to the king and said that Muhammad \n[pbuh] and his followers blasphemed Jesus Christ. Again the Muslims were \nsummoned and asked what they thought of Jesus. Ja‘far again stood up and replied: \n\"We speak about Jesus as we have been taught by our Prophet [pbuh] , that is, he is \nthe servant of All? , His Messenger, His spirit and His Word breathed into Virgin \nMary.\" The king at once remarked, \"Even so do we believe. Blessed be you, and \nblessed be your master.\" Then turning to the frowning envoys and to his bishops \nwho got angry, he said: \"You may fret and fume as you like but Jesus is nothing \nmore than what Ja‘far has said about him.\" He then assured the Muslims of full \nprotection.

It is \nrecorded that the Prophet [pbuh] was one day seated on the hillock of Safa when \n\n69\nAbu Jahl happened to pass by and accused the religion preached by him. Muhammad \n[pbuh] , however, kept silent and did not utter a single word. Abu Jahl went on \nunchecked, took a stone and cracked the Prophet’s head which began to bleed. The \naggressor then went to join the Quraishites in their assembly place. It so happened \nthat shortly after that, Hamzah, while returning from a hunting expedition, passed by \nthe same way, his bow hanging by his shoulder. A slave-girl belonging to ‘Abdullah \nbin Jada‘an, who had noted the impertinence of Abu Jahl, told him the whole story of \nthe attack on the Prophet [pbuh] . On hearing that, Hamzah was deeply offended \nand hurried to Al-Ka‘bah and there, in the courtyard of the Holy Sanctuary, found \nAbu Jahl sitting with a company of Quraishites. Hamzah rushed upon him and struck \nhis bow upon his head violently and said: \"Ah! You have been abusing Muhammad \n[pbuh] ; I too follow his religion and profess what he preaches.\" The men of Bani \nMakhzum came to his help, and men of Bani Hashim wanted to render help, but Abu \nJahl sent them away saying: \"Let Abu ‘Ummarah alone, by All? I did revile his \nnephew shamelessly.[Ibn Hisham 1/291; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/68; Mukhtasar \nSeerat Ar-Rasool p.66]\" In fact, Hamzah’s conversion derived initially from the pride \nof a man who would not accept the notion of others humiliating his relative. Later on, \nhowever, All? purified his nature and he managed to grasp the most trustworthy \nhand-hold (Faith in All? ).

It is \nrecorded that the Prophet [pbuh] was one day seated on the hillock of Safa when \n\n69\nAbu Jahl happened to pass by and accused the religion preached by him. Muhammad \n[pbuh] , however, kept silent and did not utter a single word. Abu Jahl went on \nunchecked, took a stone and cracked the Prophet’s head which began to bleed. The \naggressor then went to join the Quraishites in their assembly place. It so happened \nthat shortly after that, Hamzah, while returning from a hunting expedition, passed by \nthe same way, his bow hanging by his shoulder. A slave-girl belonging to ‘Abdullah \nbin Jada‘an, who had noted the impertinence of Abu Jahl, told him the whole story of \nthe attack on the Prophet [pbuh] . On hearing that, Hamzah was deeply offended \nand hurried to Al-Ka‘bah and there, in the courtyard of the Holy Sanctuary, found \nAbu Jahl sitting with a company of Quraishites. Hamzah rushed upon him and struck \nhis bow upon his head violently and said: \"Ah! You have been abusing Muhammad \n[pbuh] ; I too follow his religion and profess what he preaches.\" The men of Bani \nMakhzum came to his help, and men of Bani Hashim wanted to render help, but Abu \nJahl sent them away saying: \"Let Abu ‘Ummarah alone, by All? I did revile his \nnephew shamelessly.[Ibn Hisham 1/291; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/68; Mukhtasar \nSeerat Ar-Rasool p.66]\" In fact, Hamzah’s conversion derived initially from the pride \nof a man who would not accept the notion of others humiliating his relative. Later on, \nhowever, All? purified his nature and he managed to grasp the most trustworthy \nhand-hold (Faith in All? ). He proved to be a source of great strength to the Islamic \nFaith and its followers. [Mushtasar Seerat Ar-",

When he came out to see me, I told him directly that I had \nembraced Islam. He immediately slammed the door repulsively denouncing my move \nas infamous and my face as ugly.\" In fact, ‘Umar’s conversion created a great deal of \nstir in Makkah that some people denounced him as an apostate, yet he would never \nwaver in Faith, on the contrary, he persisted in his stance even at the peril of his life. \nThe polytheists of Quraish marched towards his house with the intention of killing \nhim. ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar [R] narrated: While ‘Umar was at home in a state of fear, \nthere came Al-‘As bin Wa’il As-Sahmy Abu ‘Amr, wearing an embroidered cloak and a \nshirt having silk hems. He was from the tribe of Bani Sahm who were our allies \nduring the pre-Islamic period of ignorance. Al-‘As said to ‘Umar: What’s wrong with \nyou? He said: Your people claim that they will kill me if I become a Muslim. Al-‘As \nsaid: Nobody will harm you after I have given protection to you. So Al-‘As went out \nand met the people streaming in the whole valley. He said: Where are you going? \nThey replied: We want son of Al-Khattab who has embraced Islam. Al-‘As said: There \nis no way for anybody to touch him. So the people retreated. [Bukhari 1/545; Ibn \nHisham 1/349] \nWith respect to the Muslims in Makkah, ‘Umar’s conversion had a different \ntremendous impact. Mujahid, on the authority of Ibn Al-‘Abbas [R], related that he \n\n72\nhad asked ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab why he had been given the epithet of Al-Farouque \n(he who distinguishes truth from falsehood), he replied: After I had embraced Islam, \nI asked the Prophet [pbuh]: ‘Aren’t we on the right path here and Hereafter?’ The \nProphet [pbuh] answered: ‘Of course you are! I swear by All? in Whose Hand my \nsoul is, that you are right in this world and in the hereafter.’ I, therefore, asked the \nProphet [pbuh] ‘Why we then had to conduct clandestine activism. I swear by All?\n \nWho has sent you with the Truth, that we will leave our concealment and proclaim \nour noble cause publicly.’ We then went out in two groups, Hamzah leading one and \nI the other. We headed for the Mosque in broad daylight when the polytheists of \nQuraish saw us, their faces went pale and got incredibly depressed and resentful. On \nthat very occasion, the Prophet [pbuh] attached to me the epithet of Al-Farouque. \nIbn Mas‘ud [R] related that they (the Muslims) had never been able to observe their \nreligious rites inside the Holy Sanctuary except when ‘Umar embraced Islam.

    "content": "thentic records of the biography of the Prophet [pbuh] show that it had \noccurred to the Makkan leaders to credit Muhammad [pbuh] with ambition. They, \ntherefore, time and again plied him with temptation. One day some of the important \nmen of Makkah gathered in the enclosure of Al-Ka‘bah, and ‘Utbah bin Rabi‘a, a chief \namong them, offered to approach the Prophet [pbuh] and contract a bargain with \nhim whereby they give him whatever worldly wealth he asks for, on condition that he \nkeep silent and no longer proclaim his new faith. The people of Quraish endorsed his \nproposal and requested him to undertake that task. ‘Utbah came closer to \nMuhammad [pbuh] and addressed him in the following words: \nWe have seen no other man of Arabia, who has brought so great a calamity to a \nnation, as you have done. You have outraged our gods and religion and taxed our \nforefathers and wise men with impiety and error and created strife amongst us. You \nhave left no stone unturned to estrange the relations with us. If you are doing all this \nwith a view to getting wealth, we will join together to give you greater riches than \nany Quraishite has possessed. If ambition moves you, we will make you our chief. If \nyou desire kingship we will readily offer you that. If you are under the power of an \nevil spirit which seems to haunt and dominate you so that you cannot shake off its \nyoke, then we shall call in skilful physicians to cure you. \n\"Have you said all?\" asked Muhammad [pbuh]; and then hearing that all had been \nsaid, he spoke forth, and said: \n\n73\n\"In the Name of All? , the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. H?M? . [These letters \nare one of the miracles of the Qur’? , and none but All? (Alone) knows their \nmeanings]. A revelation from All? , the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A Book \nwhereof the verses are explained in detail; — a Qur’? in Arabic for people who \nknow. Giving glad tidings [of Paradise to the one who believes in the Oneness of All?\n \n(i.e. Islamic Monotheism) and fears All? much (abstains from all kinds of sins and \nevil deeds.) and loves All? much (performing all kinds of good deeds which He has \nordained)], and warning (of punishment in the Hell-fire to the one who disbelieves in \nthe Oneness of All? ), but most of them turn away, so they listen not. And they say: \nOur hearts are under coverings (screened) from that to which you invite us …\" [Al-\nQur'an 41: 1-5] \nThe Messenger of All? [pbuh] went on reciting the Chapter while ‘Utbah sitting and \nlistening attentively with his hand behind his back to support him. When the \nMessenger reached the verse that required prostration, he immediately prostrated \nhimself. After that, he turned to ‘Utbah saying: \"Well Abu Al-Waleed! You have heard \nmy reply, you are now free to do whatever you please.\" ‘Utbah then retired to his \ncompany to apprise them of the Prophet’s attitude. When his compatriots saw him, \nthey swore that he had returned to them with a countenance unlike the one he had \nbefore meeting the Prophet [pbuh] . He immediately communicated to them the \ndetails of the talk he gave and the reply he received, and appended saying: \"I have \nnever heard words similar to those ones he recited. They definitely relate neither to \npoetry nor to witchcraft nor do they derive from soothsaying. O people of Quraish! I \nrequest you to heed my advice and grant the man full freedom to pursue his goals, \nin which case you could safely detach yourselves from him. I swear that his words \nbear a supreme Message. Should the other Arabs rid you of him, they will then spare \nyou the trouble, on the other hand if he accedes to power over the Arabs, then you \nwill bask in his kingship and share him his might.\" These words of course fell on deaf \nears, and did not appeal to the infidels, who jeered at ‘Utbah and claimed that the \nProphet [pbuh] had bewitched him. [Ibn Hisham 1/293,294] \nIn another version of the same event, it is related that ‘Utbah went on attentively \nlistening to the Prophet [pbuh] until the latter began to recite All? ’s Words: \n\"But if they turn away, they say (O Muhammad [pbuh] ): \"I have warned you of a \nSa‘iqa (a destructive awful cry, torment, hit, a thunder-bolt) like the Sa‘iqa which \novertook ‘Ad and Tham? (people).\" [Al-Qur'an 41:13] \nHere ‘Utbah",

One day some of the important \nmen of Makkah gathered in the enclosure of Al-Ka‘bah, and ‘Utbah bin Rabi‘a, a chief \namong them, offered to approach the Prophet [pbuh] and contract a bargain with \nhim whereby they give him whatever worldly wealth he asks for, on condition that he \nkeep silent and no longer proclaim his new faith. The people of Quraish endorsed his \nproposal and requested him to undertake that task. ‘Utbah came closer to \nMuhammad [pbuh] and addressed him in the following words: \nWe have seen no other man of Arabia, who has brought so great a calamity to a \nnation, as you have done. You have outraged our gods and religion and taxed our \nforefathers and wise men with impiety and error and created strife amongst us. You \nhave left no stone unturned to estrange the relations with us. If you are doing all this \nwith a view to getting wealth, we will join together to give you greater riches than \nany Quraishite has possessed. If ambition moves you, we will make you our chief. If \nyou desire kingship we will readily offer you that. If you are under the power of an \nevil spirit which seems to haunt and dominate you so that you cannot shake off its \nyoke, then we shall call in skilful physicians to cure you. \n\"Have you said all?\" asked Muhammad [pbuh]; and then hearing that all had been \nsaid, he spoke forth, and said: \n\n73\n\"In the Name of All? , the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. H?M? . [These letters \nare one of the miracles of the Qur’? , and none but All? (Alone) knows their \nmeanings]. A revelation from All? , the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A Book \nwhereof the verses are explained in detail; — a Qur’? in Arabic for people who \nknow. Giving glad tidings [of Paradise to the one who believes in the Oneness of All?\n \n(i.e. Islamic Monotheism) and fears All? much (abstains from all kinds of sins and \nevil deeds.) and loves All? much (performing all kinds of good deeds which He has \nordained)], and warning (of punishment in the Hell-fire to the one who disbelieves in \nthe Oneness of All? ), but most of them turn away, so they listen not. And they say: \nOur hearts are under coverings (screened) from that to which you invite us …\" [Al-\nQur'an 41: 1-5] \nThe Messenger of All? [pbuh] went on reciting the Chapter while ‘Utbah sitting and \nlistening attentively with his hand behind his back to support him. When the \nMessenger reached the verse that required prostration, he immediately prostrated \nhimself. After that, he turned to ‘Utbah saying: \"Well Abu Al-Waleed! You have heard \nmy reply, you are now free to do whatever you please.\" ‘Utbah then retired to his \ncompany to apprise them of the Prophet’s attitude. When his compatriots saw him, \nthey swore that he had returned to them with a countenance unlike the one he had \nbefore meeting the Prophet [pbuh] . He immediately communicated to them the \ndetails of the talk he gave and the reply he received, and appended saying: \"I have \nnever heard words similar to those ones he recited. They definitely relate neither to \npoetry nor to witchcraft nor do they derive from soothsaying. O people of Quraish! I \nrequest you to heed my advice and grant the man full freedom to pursue his goals, \nin which case you could safely detach yourselves from him. I swear that his words \nbear a supreme Message. Should the other Arabs rid you of him, they will then spare \nyou the trouble, on the other hand if he accedes to power over the Arabs, then you \nwill bask in his kingship and share him his might.\" These words of course fell on deaf \nears, and did not appeal to the infidels, who jeered at ‘Utbah and claimed that the \nProphet [pbuh] had bewitched him. [Ibn Hisham 1/293,294] \nIn another version of the same event, it is related that ‘Utbah went on attentively \nlistening to the Prophet [pbuh] until the latter began to recite All? ’s Words: \n\"But if they turn away, they say (O Muhammad [pbuh] ): \"I have warned you of a \nSa‘iqa (a destructive awful cry, torment, hit, a thunder-bolt) like the Sa‘iqa which \novertook ‘Ad and Tham? (people).\" [Al-Qur'an 41:13] \nHere ‘Utbah",

It was a stifling siege. The supply of food was almost \nstopped and the people in confinement faced great hardships. The idolaters used to \nbuy whatever food commodities entered Makkah lest they should leak to the people \nin Ash-Shi‘b, who were so overstrained that they had to eat leaves of trees and skins \nof animals. Cries of little children suffering from hunger used to be heard clearly. \nNothing to eat reached them except, on few occasions, some meagre quantities of \nfood were smuggled by some compassionate Makkans. During ‘the prohibited \nmonths’ — when hostilities traditionally ceased, they would leave their confinement \nand buy food coming from outside Makkah. Even then, the food stuff was unjustly \noverpriced so that their financial situation would fall short of finding access to it. \nHakeem bin Hizam was once on his way to smuggle some wheat to his aunt Khadijah \n[R]Ç when Abu Jahl intercepted and wanted to debar him. Only when Al-Bukhtari \nintervened, did Hakeem manage to reach his destination. Abu Talib was so much \nconcerned about the personal safety of his nephew. Whenever people retired to \nsleep, he would ask the Prophet [pbuh] to lie in his place, but when all the others fell \nasleep, he would order him to change his place and take another, all of which in an \nattempt to trick a potential assassin. \nDespite all odds, Muhammad [pbuh] persisted in his line and his determination and \ncourage never weakened. He continued to go to Al-Ka‘bah and to pray publicly. He \n\n76\nused every opportunity to preach to outsiders who visited Makkah for business or on \npilgrimage during the sacred months and special seasons of assemblies. \nThis situation ultimately created dissension amongst the various Makkan factions, \nwho were tied with the besieged people by blood relations. After three years of \nblockade and in Muharram, the tenth year of Muhammad’s mission, the pact was \nbroken. Hisham bin ‘Amr, who used to smuggle some food to Bani Hashim secretly at \nnight, went to see Zuhair bin Abi Omaiyah Al-Makhzoumy and reproached him for \nresigning to that intolerable treatment meted out to his uncles in exile. The latter \npleaded impotence, but agreed to work with Hisham and form a pressure group that \nwould secure the extrication of the exiles. On the ground of motivation by uterine \nrelations, there emerged a group of five people who set out to abrogate the pact and \ndeclare all relevant clauses null and void. They were Hisham bin ‘Amr, Zuhair bin Abi \nOmaiya, Al-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi, Abu Al-Bukhtari and Zam‘a bin Al-Aswad. They decided \nto meet in their assembly place and start their self-charged mission from the very \nprecinct of the Sacred House. Zuhair, after circumambulating seven times, along \nwith his colleagues approached the hosts of people there and rebuked them for \nindulging in the amenities of life whereas their kith and kin of Bani Hashim were \nperishing on account of starvation and economic boycott. They swore they would \nnever relent until the parchment of boycott was torn to piece and the pact broken at \nonce. Abu Jahl, standing nearby, retorted that it would never be torn. Zam‘a was \ninfuriated and accused Abu Jahl of telling lies, adding that the pact was established \nand the parchment was written without seeking their approval. Al-Bukhtari \nintervened and backed Zam‘a. Al-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi and Hisham bin ‘Amr attested to \nthe truthfulness of their two companions. Abu Jahl, with a cunning attempt to \nliquidate the hot argument that was running counter to his malicious goals, answered \nthat the issue had already been resolved sometime and somewhere before. \nAbu Talib meanwhile was sitting in a corner of the Mosque. He came to communicate \nto them that a Revelation had been sent to his nephew, the Prophet [pbuh] to the \neffect that ants had eaten away all their proclamation that smacked of injustice and \naggression except those parts that bore the Name of Allâh. He contended that he \nwould be ready to give Muhammad [pbuh] up to them if his words proved untrue, \notherwise, they would have to recant and repeal their boycott. The Makkans agreed \nto the soundness of his proposition. Al-Mut‘im went to see the parchment and there \nhe did discover that it was eaten away by ants and nothing was left save the part \nbearing (in the Name of Allâh). \nThe proclamation was thus abrogated, and Muhammad [pbuh] and the other people \nwere permitted to leave Ash-Sh‘ib and return home. In the context of this trial to \nwhich the Muslims were subjected, the polytheists had a golden opportunity to \nexperience a striking sign of Muhammad’s Prophethood (the white ants eating away \nthe parchment) but to their miserable lot they desisted and augmented in disbel",

Hisham bin ‘Amr, who used to smuggle some food to Bani Hashim secretly at \nnight, went to see Zuhair bin Abi Omaiyah Al-Makhzoumy and reproached him for \nresigning to that intolerable treatment meted out to his uncles in exile. The latter \npleaded impotence, but agreed to work with Hisham and form a pressure group that \nwould secure the extrication of the exiles. On the ground of motivation by uterine \nrelations, there emerged a group of five people who set out to abrogate the pact and \ndeclare all relevant clauses null and void. They were Hisham bin ‘Amr, Zuhair bin Abi \nOmaiya, Al-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi, Abu Al-Bukhtari and Zam‘a bin Al-Aswad. They decided \nto meet in their assembly place and start their self-charged mission from the very \nprecinct of the Sacred House. Zuhair, after circumambulating seven times, along \nwith his colleagues approached the hosts of people there and rebuked them for \nindulging in the amenities of life whereas their kith and kin of Bani Hashim were \nperishing on account of starvation and economic boycott. They swore they would \nnever relent until the parchment of boycott was torn to piece and the pact broken at \nonce. Abu Jahl, standing nearby, retorted that it would never be torn. Zam‘a was \ninfuriated and accused Abu Jahl of telling lies, adding that the pact was established \nand the parchment was written without seeking their approval. Al-Bukhtari \nintervened and backed Zam‘a. Al-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi and Hisham bin ‘Amr attested to \nthe truthfulness of their two companions. Abu Jahl, with a cunning attempt to \nliquidate the hot argument that was running counter to his malicious goals, answered \nthat the issue had already been resolved sometime and somewhere before. \nAbu Talib meanwhile was sitting in a corner of the Mosque. He came to communicate \nto them that a Revelation had been sent to his nephew, the Prophet [pbuh] to the \neffect that ants had eaten away all their proclamation that smacked of injustice and \naggression except those parts that bore the Name of Allâh. He contended that he \nwould be ready to give Muhammad [pbuh] up to them if his words proved untrue, \notherwise, they would have to recant and repeal their boycott. The Makkans agreed \nto the soundness of his proposition. Al-Mut‘im went to see the parchment and there \nhe did discover that it was eaten away by ants and nothing was left save the part \nbearing (in the Name of Allâh). \nThe proclamation was thus abrogated, and Muhammad [pbuh] and the other people \nwere permitted to leave Ash-Sh‘ib and return home. In the context of this trial to \nwhich the Muslims were subjected, the polytheists had a golden opportunity to \nexperience a striking sign of Muhammad’s Prophethood (the white ants eating away \nthe parchment) but to their miserable lot they desisted and augmented in disbel",

Quraish, likewise, repealed the boycott but went on in their atrocities and \noppression on the Muslims. Abu Talib, the octogenarian notable, was still keen on \nshielding his nephew but by that time, and on account of the series of tremendous \nevents and continual pains, he began to develop certain fits of weakness. No sooner \nhad he emerged victorious from the inhuman boycott, than he was caught in a \npersistent illness and physical enervation. The polytheists of Makkah, seeing this \nserious situation and fearing that the stain of infamy that the other Arabs could \nattribute to them in case they took any aggressive action against the Prophet [pbuh] \nafter he had lost his main support, Abu Talib, took a decision to negotiate with the \nProphet [pbuh] once more and submit some concessions withheld previously. They \nthen delegated some representatives to see Abu Talib and discuss the issue with \nhim. Ibn Ishaq and others related: \"When a serious illness caught Abu Talib, the \npeople of Quraish began to deliberate on the situation and reviewed the main \nfeatures that characterized that period and which included the conversion of ‘Umar \nand Hamzah to Islam, coupled with the tremendous stir that Muhammad [pbuh] had \ncreated amongst all the tribes of Quraish. They then deemed it imperative to see \nAbu Talib before he died to pressure his nephew to negotiate a compromise on the \nvarious disputed points. They were afraid that the other Arabs might attribute to \nthem the charge of opportunism.\" \nThe delegation of Quraish comprised 25 men including notables like ‘Utbah bin \nRabi‘a, Shaibah bin Rabi‘a, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, Omaiyah bin Khalaf, Abu Sufyan bin \nHarb. They first paid tribute to him and confirmed their high esteem of his person \nand position among them. They then shifted to the new give-and-take policy that \nthey claimed they wanted to follow. To substantiate their argument they alleged that \nthey would refrain from intervening in his religion if he did the same. \nAbu Talib summoned his nephew and apprised him of the minutes of his meeting \nwith them, and said: \"Well, my nephew, here are the celebrities of your people. They \nhave proposed this meeting to submit a policy of mutual concessions and peaceful \ncoexistence.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned to them saying: \n\"I will guide you to the means by which you will gain sovereignty over both \nthe Arabs and non-Arabs.\" \nIn another version, the Prophet [pbuh] addressed Abu Talib in the following words: \n\"O uncle! Why don’t you call them unto something better?\" Abu Talib asked him, \n\"What is it that you invite them to?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied, \"I invite them to \nhold fast to a Message that is bound to give them access to kingship over the Arabs \nand non-Arabs.\" According to Ibn Ishaq’s version, \"It is just one word that will give \nyou supremacy over the Arabs and non-Arabs.\" The Makkan deputies were taken by \nincredible surprise and began to wonder what sort of word was that which would \nbenefit them to that extent. Abu Jahl asked, \"What is that word? I swear by your \nfather that we will surely grant you your wish followed by ten times as much.\" He \nsaid, \"I want you to testify that there is no god worthy to be worshipped but Allâh, \nand then divest yourselves of any sort of worship you harbour for any deities other \nthan Allâh.\" They immediately clapped their hands in ridicule, and said \"How can you \nexpect us to combine all the deities in one God. It is really something incredible.\" On \ntheir way out leaving, they said to one another, \"By god this man (Muhammad \n\n78\n[pbuh] ) will never relent, nor will he offer any concessions. Let us hold fast to the \nreligion of our forefathers, and Allâ h will in due course adjudicate and settle the \ndispute between us and him.\" As regards this incident, Allâh revealed the following \nverses: \n\"Sâd: [These letters (Sâd, etc.) are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân and \nnone but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings]. By the Qur’ân full of \nreminding. Nay, those who disbelieve are in false pride and Apposition. How \nmany a generation We have destroyed before them, and they cried out \nwhen there was no longer time for escape! And they (Arab pagans) wonder \nthat a warner (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) has come to them from among \nthemselves! And the disbelievers say, ‘This (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) is \na sorcerer, a liar. Has he made the gods (all) into One God (Allâh). Verily, \nthis is a curious thing!’ And the leaders among them went about (saying): \n‘Go on, and remain constant to your gods! Verily, this is a thing designed \n(against you)! We have not heard (the like) of this among the people of \nthese later days. This is nothing but an invention.’\" [Al-Qur'an 38:1-7]",

    "content": "In Rajab[Tareekh Al-Islam 1/120], the tenth year of the Prophethood, Abu Talib fell \nill and passed away, six months after leaving the confinement at Ash-Sh‘ib. In \nanother version, Abu Talib breathed his last in Ramadan, three days prior to the \ndeath of Khadijah [R] . On the authority of Al-Musaiyab, when Abu Talib was on the \ndeath bed, the Prophet [pbuh] entered the room where he saw Abu Jahl and \n‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah. He requested his uncle: \n\"My uncle, you just make a profession that there is no true god but Allâh, \nand I will bear testimony before Allâh (of your being a believer)\". \nAbu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah addressing him said: \"Abu Talib, would you \nabandon the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib?\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] constantly \nrequested him (to accept his offer), and (on the other hand) was repeated the same \nstatement (of Abu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah) — till Abu Talib gave his final \ndecision and he stuck to the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib and refused to profess that \nthere is no true god but Allâh. Upon this the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remarked: \n\"By Allâh, I will persistently beg pardon for you till I am forbidden to do so \n(by Allâh)\". \nIt was then that Allâh, the Magnificent and Glorious revealed this verse: \n\"It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allâh’s \nforgiveness for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers \nin the Oneness of Allâh) even though they be of kin, after it has become \nclear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a \nstate of disbelief).\" [Al-Qur'an 9:113] \nAnd it was said to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]: \n\"Verily! You (O Muhammad [pbuh]) guide not whom you like.\" [Al-Qur'an \n28:56] [Bukhari 1/548] \nIt goes without saying that Abu Talib was very much attached to Muhammad [pbuh] \n. For forty years, Abu Talib had been the faithful friend — the prop of his childhood, \nthe guardian of his youth and in later life a very tower of defence. The sacrifices to \nwhich Abu Talib exposed himself and his family for the sake of his nephew, while yet \nincredulous of his mission, stamp his character as singularly noble and unselfish. The \nProphet [pbuh] did his best to persuade his octogenarian uncle to make profession of \nthe true faith, but he remained obdurate and stuck to the paganism of his \nforefathers, and thus could not achieve complete success. Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul-\nMuttalib narrated that he said to the Prophet [pbuh] \"You have not been of any avail \nto your uncle (Abu Talib) (though) by Allâh, he used to protect you and get angry on \nyour behalf.\" The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"He is in a shallow fire, and had it not been \nfor",

But contrary to his expectations, the \ngeneral atmosphere was terribly hostile. He approached the family of ‘Umair, who \nwere reckoned amongst the nobility of the town. But, to his disappointment, all of \nthem turned deaf ear to his message and used abusive language as regards the \nnoble cause he had been striving for. Three brothers from the chieftains of Thaqeef \n—‘Abd Yaleel, Mas‘ud and Habeeb — sons of ‘Amr bin ‘Umair Ath-Thaqafy met the \nProphet [pbuh], who invited them to embrace Islam and worship Allâh, but they \nimpudently jeered at him and refused his invitation. \"He is tearing the cloths of Al-\nKa‘bah; is it true that Allâh has sent you as a Messenger?\" said one of them. \"Has \nnot Allâh found someone else to entrust him with His Message?\" said the second. \"I \nswear by Allâh that I will never have any contact with you. If you are really the \nMessenger of Allâh, then you are too serious to retort back; and if you are belying \nAllâh, then I feel it is imperative not to speak to.\" said the third. The Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh], finding that they were hopeless cases, stood up and left them saying: \n\"Should you indulge in these practices of yours, never divulge them to me.\" \nFor ten days he stayed there delivering his message to several people, one after \nanother, but all to no purpose. Stirred up to hasten the departure of the unwelcome \nvisitor, the people hooted him through the alley-ways, pelted him with stones and \nobliged him to flee from the city pursued by a relentless rabble. Blood flowed down \nboth his legs; and Zaid, endeavouring to shield him, was wounded in the head. The \nmob did not desist until they had chased him two or three miles across the sandy \nplains to the foot of the surrounding hills. There, wearied and exhausted, he took \nrefuge in one of the numerous orchards, and rested against the wall of a vineyard. At \na time when the whole world seemed to have turned against him, Muhammad \n[pbuh] turned to his Lord and betook himself to prayer and the following touching \nwords are still preserved as those through which his oppressed soul gave vent to its \ndistress. He was weary and wounded but confident of the help of his Lord: \n\"O Allâh! To You alone I make complaint of my helplessness, the paucity of \nmy resources and my insignificance before mankind. You are the most \nMerciful of the mercifuls. You are the Lord of the helpless and the weak, O \nLord of mine! Into whose hands would You abandon me: into the hands of \nan unsympathetic distant relative who would sullenly frown at me, or to the \nenemy who has been given control over my affairs?

However, the context of the \ndifferent versions suggests that the jinns repeated their visits later on. The presence \nof that company of jinns comes in the context of the Divine support given to His \nMessenger, and constitutes a propitious sign of ultimate victory and success for the \nCall of Islam. It provides an unshakable proof that no power however mighty could \nalter what is wrought by Allâh: \n\"And whosoever does not respond to Allâh’s Caller, he cannot escape on \nearth, and there will be no Auliyâ (protectors) from him besides Allâh (from \nAllâh’s punishment). Those are in manifest error.\" [Al-Qur'an 46:32] \n\"And we think that we cannot escape (from the punishment of) Allâ h in the \nearth, nor can we escape (from the punishment) by flight.\" [Al-Qur'an 72:12] \nGiven this support and auspicious start, depression, dismay and sadness that used to \nbeset him since he was driven out of At-Ta’if, he turned his face towards Makkah \nwith fresh determination to resume his earlier plan to expose people to Islam and \ncommunicate his Message in a great spirit of zeal and matchless enthusiasm. \nZaid bin Harithah, his companion, addressing the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"How dare \nyou step into Makkah after they (Quraish) have expatriated you?\" The Prophet \n[pbuh] answered: \"Hearken Zaid, Allâh will surely provide relief and He will verily \nsupport His religion and Prophet.\" \nWhen he was a short distance from Makkah, he retired to Hira’ Cave. Whence he \ndespatched a man from Khuza‘ah tribe to Al-Akhnas bin Shuraiq seeking his \nprotection. The latter answered that he was Quraish’s ally and in no position to offer \nprotection. He despatched the messenger to Suhail bin ‘Amr, but to no avail, either. \nAl-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi, a notable in Makkah, however, volunteered to respond to the \nProphet’s appeal for shelter.

    "content": "res of Heavens) \nThe last days of the Makkan phase of the Prophet’s life are noted for alternate \nfortunes ranging between two extremes: gradual success and continual persecution. \nHowever, glimpses of propitious lights were looming on the distant horizon, to \nultimately materialize in the event of the Prophet’s Night Journey to Jerusalem and \nthen Ascension through the spheres of the heavens. \nAs for its exact date, it is still controversial and no common consent has been \nreached. However, the majority of jurists is in favour of a date between 16-12 \nmonths prior to migration to Madinah. The following is a epitome of the details of \nthat miraculous event narrated on the authority of Ibn Al-Qayyim.[Za'd Al-Ma'ad \n2/49; Tareekh-e-Islam 1/124; Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/76] \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was carried in body from the Sacred Mosque in \nMakkah to the Distant Mosque in Jerusalem on a horse called Al-Buraq in the \ncompany of Gabriel, the archangel. There he alighted, tethered the horse to a ring in \nthe gate of the Mosque and led the Prophets in prayer. After that Gabriel took him to \nthe heavens on the same horse. When they reached the first heaven Gabriel asked \nthe guardian angel to open the door of heaven. It was opened and he saw Adam, the \nprogenitor of mankind. The Prophet [pbuh] saluted him and the other welcomed him \nand expressed his faith in Muhammad’s Prophethood. He saw the souls of martyrs on \nhis right and those of the wretched on his left. \nGabriel then ascended with the Prophet to the second heaven, asked for opening the \ngate and there he saw and saluted John, son of Zachariya (Yahya bin Zakariya) and \nJesus, son of Mary. They returned the salutation, welcomed him and expressed their \nfaith in his Prophethood. Then they reached the third heaven where they saw Joseph \n(Yusuf) and saluted him. The latter welcomed the Prophet and expressed faith in his \nProphethood. The Prophet, in the company of Gabriel, then reached the fourth \nheaven where he met the Prophet Enoch (Idris) and saluted him. Prophet Enoch \nreturned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. Then he was carried \nto the fifth heaven where he met the Prophet Aaron (Harun) and saluted him. The \nlatter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. In the sixth \nheaven he met Moses (Musa) and saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and \nexpressed faith in his Prophethood. Muhammad [pbuh] on leaving, saw that Moses \nbegan to weep. He asked about the reason. Moses answered that he was weeping \nbecause he witnessed a man sent after him as a Messenger (Muhammad) who was \nable to lead more of his people to the Paradise than he himself did. Then Prophet \nMuhammad [pbuh] reached the seventh heaven and met Abraham (Ibrahim)[AWS] \nand saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his \nProphethood. Then he was carried to Sidrat-al-Muntaha (the remotest lote tree) and \nwas shown Al-Bait-al-Ma‘mûr [(the much frequented house) which is like the Ka‘bah \n(Sacred House) encompassed daily by seventy thousand angels, so that the angels \nwho once encompassed it would not have their turn again till the Resurrection]. He \nwas then presented to the Divine Presence and experienced the thrill of witnessing \nthe Divine Glory and Manifestation at the closest possible propinquity. There the Lord \nrevealed unto His servant that which He revealed, and ordained fifty daily prayers for \nhim. On his return, he spoke to Moses that his followers had been enjoined to pray \n\n90\nfifty times a day. Moses addressing the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Your followers cannot \nperform so many prayers. Go back to your Lord and ask for a remission in number.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] turned to Gabriel as if holding counsel with him. Gabriel nodded, \n\"Yes, if you desire,\" and ascended with him to the Presence of Allâh. The All-Mighty \nAllâh, Glory is to Him, made a reduction of ten prayers. He then descended and \nreported that to Moses, who again urged him to request for a further reduction. \nMuhammad [pbuh] once more begged his Lord to reduce the number still further. He \nwent again and again in the Presence of Allâh at the suggestion of Moses for \nreduction in the number of prayers till these were reduced to five only. Moses again \nasked him to implore for more reduction, but he said: \"I feel ashamed now of \nrepeatedly asking my Lord for reduction. I accept and resign to His Will.\" When \nMuhammad [pbuh] went farther, a Caller was heard sayi",

He saw the souls of martyrs on \nhis right and those of the wretched on his left. \nGabriel then ascended with the Prophet to the second heaven, asked for opening the \ngate and there he saw and saluted John, son of Zachariya (Yahya bin Zakariya) and \nJesus, son of Mary. They returned the salutation, welcomed him and expressed their \nfaith in his Prophethood. Then they reached the third heaven where they saw Joseph \n(Yusuf) and saluted him. The latter welcomed the Prophet and expressed faith in his \nProphethood. The Prophet, in the company of Gabriel, then reached the fourth \nheaven where he met the Prophet Enoch (Idris) and saluted him. Prophet Enoch \nreturned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. Then he was carried \nto the fifth heaven where he met the Prophet Aaron (Harun) and saluted him. The \nlatter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. In the sixth \nheaven he met Moses (Musa) and saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and \nexpressed faith in his Prophethood. Muhammad [pbuh] on leaving, saw that Moses \nbegan to weep. He asked about the reason. Moses answered that he was weeping \nbecause he witnessed a man sent after him as a Messenger (Muhammad) who was \nable to lead more of his people to the Paradise than he himself did. Then Prophet \nMuhammad [pbuh] reached the seventh heaven and met Abraham (Ibrahim)[AWS] \nand saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his \nProphethood. Then he was carried to Sidrat-al-Muntaha (the remotest lote tree) and \nwas shown Al-Bait-al-Ma‘mûr [(the much frequented house) which is like the Ka‘bah \n(Sacred House) encompassed daily by seventy thousand angels, so that the angels \nwho once encompassed it would not have their turn again till the Resurrection]. He \nwas then presented to the Divine Presence and experienced the thrill of witnessing \nthe Divine Glory and Manifestation at the closest possible propinquity. There the Lord \nrevealed unto His servant that which He revealed, and ordained fifty daily prayers for \nhim. On his return, he spoke to Moses that his followers had been enjoined to pray \n\n90\nfifty times a day. Moses addressing the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Your followers cannot \nperform so many prayers. Go back to your Lord and ask for a remission in number.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] turned to Gabriel as if holding counsel with him. Gabriel nodded, \n\"Yes, if you desire,\" and ascended with him to the Presence of Allâh. The All-Mighty \nAllâh, Glory is to Him, made a reduction of ten prayers. He then descended and \nreported that to Moses, who again urged him to request for a further reduction. \nMuhammad [pbuh] once more begged his Lord to reduce the number still further. He \nwent again and again in the Presence of Allâh at the suggestion of Moses for \nreduction in the number of prayers till these were reduced to five only. Moses again \nasked him to implore for more reduction, but he said: \"I feel ashamed now of \nrepeatedly asking my Lord for reduction. I accept and resign to His Will.\" When \nMuhammad [pbuh] went farther, a Caller was heard sayi",

Some interpreters say that seeing Allâh with his \nnaked eyes was not confirmed. Ibn ‘Abbas, on the other hand, says that the word \nRu’ya as used in the Noble Qur’ân signifies the observation with the help of the eye. \nIn Sûrah An–Najm (Chapter —The Star) we read: \n\"Then he approached and came closer.\" [Al-Qur'an 53:8] \nHere (he) refers to archangel Gabriel, and this context is completely different from \nthat in the Prophetic tradition of Isra’ and Mi‘raj, where ‘the approach’ relates to that \nof the Lord, Glory is to Him. \nSome significant suggestive incidents featured the ‘Night Journey’ of the Prophet, of \nwhich we could mention: \n1. The Prophet’s breast was cleft by Gabriel, his heart extracted and washed \nwith the water of Zamzam —a sacred spring in Makkah. \n2. In the same context, there were brought to him two gold vessels. There was \nmilk in one, while the other was full of wine. He was asked to choose either of \nthem, so he selected the vessel containing milk and drank it. He (the angel) \nsaid: \"You have been guided on Al-Fitrah or you have attained Al-Fitrah. Had \nyou selected wine, your nation would have been misled.\" [It is a symbolic way \nof saying that good and evil in the form of milk and wine were brought before \nthe Prophet and he instinctively made a choice for the good. It is very difficult \nto render the Arabic term ‘Fitrah’ into English. It denotes the original \nconstitution or disposition, with which a child comes into this world, as \ncontrasted with qualities or inclinations acquired during life; besides it refers \nto the spiritual inclination inherent in man in his unspoilt state]. \n3. The Prophet [pbuh] told that he saw two manifest rivers, — the Nile and the \nEuphrates — and two hidden ones. It appears that the two manifest rivers, \nthe Nile and the Euphrates, symbolically describe the area in whose fertile \nvalleys, Muhammad’s Message will settle, and the people whereof will always \nremain the adherent bearers of Islam that will be passed on from generation \nto another. They can by no means suggest that they well up from the Garden. \n4. He had the opportunity to see Malik, the guardian of Hell, with a cheerless \nfrowning face. Therein, he saw the Hell dwellers, of whom were those who \n\n91\nunjustly eat up the property of the orphans. They have flews similar to those \nof camels, swallowing red-hot stones and then issuing out of their backs. \nThere were also the people who take usury with bellies too big to be able to \nmove around; they are trodden by the people of Pharaoh when these are \nadmitted into Hell. In the same abode, he saw the adulterers offered tasty \nfatty meat and rotten smelly one but they make option for the latter. The \nlicentious women were also there hanging from their breasts. \n5. The ‘Night Journey’ raised a good deal of stir among the people and the \nsceptical audience plied Muhammad with all sorts of questions. He told them \nthat he saw the camels of Makkan merchants to and fro. He also guided them \nto some of their animals that went astray. He informed them that he had \ndrunk some of their water while they were fast asleep and left the container \ncovered. \nThe disbelievers, however, found it a suitable opportunity to jeer at the Muslims and \ntheir creed. They pestered the Prophet [pbuh] with questions as to the description of \nthe Mosque at Jerusalem, where he had never gone before and, to the astonishment \nof many, the Prophet’s replies furnished the most accurate information about that \ncity. He supplied them with all the news about their caravans and the routes of their \ncamels. However, all this increased in them nothing but flight from the Truth, and \nthey accepted nothing but disbelief. \nFor the true Muslims, however there was nothing unusual about the Night Journey. \nThe All-Mighty Allâh, Who is Powerful enough to have created the heavens and the \nearth by an act of His Will, is surely Powerful enough to take His Messenger beyond \nthe heavens and show him those signs of His at firsthand which are inaccessible to \nman otherwise.

They are in fact eligible for this Divine privilege \n\n92\nbecause they are the ones who will bear burdens too heavy for other ordinary people \nto carry, and in the process of their mission, they will regard all worldly ordeals and \nagonies too small to care about. \nThere are simple facts that emanate from this blessed Journey, and flow along into \nthe flowery garden of the Prophetic biography; peace and blessings of Allâh be upon \nits author, Muhammad. The story of ‘the Night Journey’ as we see in the Noble \nQur’ân is epitomised in the first verse of the Sûrah Isra’(Chapter 17 — The Journey \nby Night) then there is a quick shift to uncover the shameful deeds and crimes of the \nJews, followed by an admonition saying that the Qur’ân guides to that which is most \njust and right. This arrangement is not in fact a mere coincidence. Jerusalem was the \nfirst scene of the Night Journey, and here lies the message directed to the Jews and \nwhich explicitly suggested that they would be discharged of the office of leadership \nof mankind due to the crimes they had perpetrated and which no longer justified \ntheir occupation of that office. The message suggested explicitly that the office of \nleadership would be reinstituted by the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to hold in his hand \nboth headquarters of the Abrahamic Faith, the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah and the \nFarthest Mosque in Jerusalem. It was high time for the spiritual authority to be \ntransferred from a nation whose history got pregnant with treachery, covenant-\nbreaching and aggression to another nation blessed with piety, and dutifulness to \nAllâh, with a Messenger who enjoys the privilege of the Qur’ânic Revelation, which \nleads to that which is best and right. \nThere, however, remains a crucial question waiting to be answered: How could this \nforeseen transition of authority be effected while the champion himself (Muhammad) \nwas left deserted and forsaken stumbling in the hillocks of Makkah? This question per \nse uncovered the secrets of another issue which referred to a phase of the Islamic \nCall and the appearance of another role it was about to take up, different in its \ncourse and noble in its approaches. The forerunners of that new task took the shape \nof Qur’ânic verses smacking of direct and unequivocal warning accompanied by a \nsevere ultimatum directed to the polytheists and their agents: \n\"And when We decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a \ndefinite order (to obey Allâh and be righteous) to those among them [ or We \n(first) increase in number those of its population] who are given the good \nthings of this life. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of \ntorment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete \ndestruction. And how many generations (past nations) have We destroyed \nafter Noah! And Sufficient is your Lord as an All-Knower and All-Beholder of \nthe sins of His slaves.\" [Al-Qur'an 17:16, 17] \nTogether with these verses, there were others revealed to show the Muslims the \nrules and items of the civilization upon which they could erect their Muslim \ncommunity, and foreshadowing their ownership of a piece of land, exercising full \nfreedom over it and establishing a coherent society around whose axis the whole \nhumanity would rotate. Those verses in reality implied better prospects for the \nProphet [pbuh] comprising a secure shelter to settle in, and headquarters safe \nenough to empower and embolden him to communicate his Message to all the world \nat large; that was in fact the inner secret of that blessed journey.

He responded and did exactly what he was asked \nto do, and then said there was a man (Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh) whose people would never \nhang back if he followed the Islam.

The Prophet immediately knew that it was a certain pudgy ugly devil, \ninhabited in Al-‘Aqabah, who discovered their meeting, and he threatened to settle \nhis account with him as soon as possible. \nOn hearing this, Al-‘Abbas bin Nadlah said \"By Allâh, Who has sent you in Truth, we \nare powerful enough to put the people of Mina (the Quraishites) to our swords \ntomorrow, if you desire.\" The Prophet [pbuh] said \"We have not been commanded to \nfollow that course. Now, back to your camps.\" They went back to sleep till morning. \n[Ibn Hisham 1/448] \nNo sooner did Quraish hear of this treaty than a kind of trouble-provoking tumult \nbegan to mushroom in all directions. They realized quite fully that an allegiance of \nthis sort is bound to produce far-reaching ramifications of direct impact on their lives \nand wealth. The following day, a large delegation comprising the leaders and arch-\ncriminals of Makkah set out for the camp of the Madinese to protest severely against \nthe treaty. They addressed the Madinese: \"O people of Khazraj, it transpired to us \nthat you have come here to conclude a treaty with this man (Muhammad) and \n\n98\nevacuate him out of Makkah. By Allâh, we do really hold in abhorrence any sort of \nfight between you and us.\" [Ibn Hisham 1/448] \nThe Madinese polytheists having known nothing about the secretly taken pledge, \nbegan to swear by Allâh and answered in good faith that there was no truth in the \nreport. ‘Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, a Madinese polytheist, refuted their allegations \ndenouncing them as null and void, claiming that his people would never initiate \nanything unless he gave them clear orders. \nThe Madinese Muslims, however, remained silent neither negating nor confirming. \nThe Quraishite leaders seemed to be almost convinced by the arguments presented \nby the polytheists, and went back home frustrated. However, they did not fully \nacquiesce in the words they heard. They began to scrutinize the smallest details, and \ntrace the minutest news till it was established beyond a shadow of doubt that the \npact did take place, but that was after the Madinese pilgrims had left Makkah. In a fit \nof rage, they pursued the pilgrims but did not succeed in catching hold of anyone \nexcept Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah. They subjected him to unspeakable tortures, but he was \nlater rescued by Al-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi and Harith bin Harb bin Omaiya with whom he \nhad trade relations. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/51,52; Ibn Hisham 1/448-450] \nThat is the story of the Second ‘Aqabah Pledge, later known as the Great ‘Aqabah \nPledge, effected in an atmosphere of love, allegiance and mutual support between \nMadinese believers and weak Makkan Muslims. This new spirit of affection, rapport \nand cooperation could never be attributable to a fleeing whim, on the contrary, it \ntotally derived from an already deeply-established approach, viz. Belief in Allâh, His \nMessenger and His Book. It was a Belief so rooted in the selves that it managed to \nstand immune to all powers of injustice and aggression, and could be translated into \nmiracles in the practical aspects of action and ideology pursuit. That sort of Belief \nwas the real instrument for the Muslims to record in the annals of history \nunprecedented",

They began to scrutinize the smallest details, and \ntrace the minutest news till it was established beyond a shadow of doubt that the \npact did take place, but that was after the Madinese pilgrims had left Makkah. In a fit \nof rage, they pursued the pilgrims but did not succeed in catching hold of anyone \nexcept Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah. They subjected him to unspeakable tortures, but he was \nlater rescued by Al-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi and Harith bin Harb bin Omaiya with whom he \nhad trade relations. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/51,52; Ibn Hisham 1/448-450] \nThat is the story of the Second ‘Aqabah Pledge, later known as the Great ‘Aqabah \nPledge, effected in an atmosphere of love, allegiance and mutual support between \nMadinese believers and weak Makkan Muslims. This new spirit of affection, rapport \nand cooperation could never be attributable to a fleeing whim, on the contrary, it \ntotally derived from an already deeply-established approach, viz. Belief in Allâh, His \nMessenger and His Book. It was a Belief so rooted in the selves that it managed to \nstand immune to all powers of injustice and aggression, and could be translated into \nmiracles in the practical aspects of action and ideology pursuit. That sort of Belief \nwas the real instrument for the Muslims to record in the annals of history \nunprecedented",

He fixed to him the time of migration and asked him not to sleep that night \nin his usual bed. At noon, the Prophet [pbuh] went to see his Companion Abu Bakr \nand arranged with him everything for the intended migration. Abu Bakr was \nsurprised to see the Prophet [pbuh] masked coming to visit him at that unusual \ntime, but he soon learned that Allâh’s Command had arrived, and he proposed that \nthey should migrate together, to which the Prophet [pbuh] gave his consent.[Bukhari \n1/553] \nTo make the necessary preparations for the implementation of their devilish plan, the \nchiefs of Makkah had chosen eleven men: Abu Jahl, Hakam bin Abil Al-‘As, ‘Uqbah \nbin Abi Mu‘ait, An-Nadr bin Harith, Omaiyah bin Khalaf, Zama‘a bin Al-Aswad, \nTu‘aima bin ‘Adi, Abu Lahab, Ubai bin Khalaf, Nabih bin Al-Hajjaj and his brother \nMunbih bin Al-Hajjaj.

At noon, the Prophet [pbuh] went to see his Companion Abu Bakr \nand arranged with him everything for the intended migration.

He walked for 5 miles until he reached a \nrough rocky mountain called Thawr. There his shoes were worn out, some said he \nused to walk tiptoe in order not to leave a trail behind him. Abu Bakr [R] carried him \nup the mountain to a cave called after the name of the mountain, Cave Thawr. Abu \nBakr first entered to explore the cave and be sure that it was safe, closed all holes \nwith pieces torn off from his clothes, cleaned it and then asked the Prophet [pbuh] to \nstep in. The Prophet [pbuh] went in and immediately laid his head in Abu Bakr’s lap \nand fell asleep. Suddenly Abu Bakr’s foot was stung by a poisonous insect. It hurt so \nmuch that his tears fell on the Prophet’s face. The Prophet [pbuh] immediately \napplied his saliva on Abu Bakr’s foot and the pain went off on the spot. They confined \nthemselves to this cave for three nights, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. ‘Abdullah, the \nson of Abu Bakr would go to see them after dusk, stay the night there, apprise them \nof the latest situation in Makkah, and then leave in the early morning to mix with the \nMakkans as usual and not to draw the least attention to his clandestine activities. \n‘Amir bin Fuhairah, while in the company of other shepherds of Makkah tending his \nmaster Abu Bakr’s flock, used to stole away unobserved every evening with a few \ngoats to the cave and furnished its inmates with a plentiful supply of milk.[Bukhari 1/553; \nIbn Hisham 1/486] \nQuraish, on the other hand, were quite baffled and exasperated when the news of \nthe escape of the two companions was confirmed. They brought ‘Ali to Al-Ka‘bah, \nbeat him brutally and confined him there for an hour attempting desperately to make \nhim divulge the secret of the disappearance of the two ‘fugitives’, but to no avail. \nThey then went to see Asma’, Abu Bakr’s daughter, but here also their attempts \nwent in vain.

His report \nsatisfied the noble ‘fugitives’ that the search had slackened. The opportunity to \ndepart was come. Here Abu Bakr offered the Prophet [pbuh] the swift animal to ride \non. The latter agreed provided that he would pay its price.

In this context, it is relevant to introduce some interesting incidents that \nfeatured their wearying journey: \n1. One day they could find no shelter from the scorching heat so Abu Bakr [R] \ncast a glance and found a little shade beside a rock. He cleaned the ground, \nspread his mantle for the Prophet [pbuh] to lie on and himself went off in \nsearch of food. He came across a shepherd, a bedouin boy, who was also \nseeking a shelter. Abu Bakr asked him for some milk and took it to the \nProphet [pbuh], cooled it with some water and waited till the Prophet [pbuh] \nwoke up and quenched his thirst.[Bukhari 1/510] \n2. Whoever asked Abu Bakr [R] about the identity of his honourable companion, \nhe would reply that he was a man who guided him on his way. The questioner \nwould think that Muhammad [pbuh] was a guide, in terms of roads, whereas \nAbu Bakr used to mean guide to the way of righteousness.[Bukhari 1/556] \n3. Quraish, as we have already mentioned, had declared that whoever would \nseize Muhammad [pbuh] would receive a hundred camels as reward. This had \nspurred many persons to try their luck. Among those who were on the \nlookout for the Prophet [pbuh] and his companion in order to win the reward \nwas Suraqah, the son of Malik. He, on receiving information that a party of \nfour, had been spotted on a certain route, decided to pursue it secretly so \nthat he alone should be the winner of the reward. He mounted a swift horse \nand went in hot pursuit of them. On the way the horse stumbled and he fell \non the ground. On drawing a lot so as to divine whether he should continue \nthe chase or not, as the Arabs used to do in such circumstances, he found the \nomens unpropitious. But the lust for material wealth blinded him altogether \nand he resumed the chase. Once more he met with the same fate but paid no \nheed to it. Again he jumped onto the saddle and galloped at a break-neck \nspeed till he came quite close to the Prophet [pbuh]. Abu Bakr’s heart \nagitated and he kept looking back while the Prophet [pbuh] remained \nsteadfast and continued reciting verses of the Qur’ân. \nThe repeated stumbling of Suraqah’s horse and his falling off awakened him \nto the situation, and he realized that it was a constant warning of Allâh for his \nevil design which he contemplated against the Prophet [pbuh].

He addressed the Prophet [pbuh] and his \ncompanion, saying: \"Your people (the Quraishites) have promised a generous \nreward to anyone who captures you.\" He added that he offered them \nprovision but they declined his offer.

Hence it was incumbent upon \nevery capable Muslim to contribute to building this new homeland, immunizing it and \nholding up its prop. As a leader and spiritual guide, there was no doubt the Noble \nMessenger [pbuh], in whose hands exclusively all affairs would be resolved. \nIn Madinah, the Prophet [pbuh] had to deal with three distinctively different \ncategories of people with different respective problems: \n1. His Companions, the noble and Allâh fearing elite [R] \n2. Polytheists still detached from the Islam and were purely \nMadinese tribes. \n3. The Jews. \n1. As for his Companions, the conditions of life in Madinah were totally different \nfrom those they experienced in Makkah. There, in Makkah, they used to strive \nfor one corporate target, but physically, they were scattered, overpowered \nand forsaken. They were helpless in terms of pursuing their new course of \norientation. Their means, socially and materially, fell short of establishing a \nnew Muslim community. In parallel lines, the Makkan Chapters of the Noble \nQur’ân were confined to delineating the Islamic precepts, enacting legislations \npertaining to the believers individually and enjoining good and piety and \nforbidding evils and vices. \nIn Madinah , things were otherwise; here all the affairs of their life rested in \ntheir hands. Now, they were at ease and could quite confidently handle the \nchallenges of civilization, construction, means of living, economics, politics, \ngovernment administration, war and peace, codification of the questions of \nthe allowed and prohibited, worship, ethics and all the relevant issues. In a \nnutshell, they were in Madinah at full liberty to erect the pillars of a new \nMuslim community not only utterly different from that pre-Islamic code of life, \nbut also distinctive in its features in the world at large. It was a society that \n\n110\ncould stand for the Islamic Call for whose sake the Muslims had been put to \nunspeakable tortures for 10 years. No doubt, the construction of a society \nthat runs in line with this type of ethics cannot be accomplished overnight, \nwithin a month or a year. It requires a long time to build during which \nlegislation and legalization will run gradually in a complementary process with \nmind cultivation, training and education.

Second, Islam came to bring \nabout a spirit of rapport, to terminate the state of enmity and hatred, and to \nestablish a social regime based on denunciation of the prohibited and promotion of \nthe allowed. Adherence to these canons of life implied paving the way for an Arab \nunity that could work to the prejudice of the Jews and their interests at both the \nsocial and economic levels; the Arab tribes would then try to restore their wealth and \nland misappropriated by the Jews through usurious practices. \nThe Jews of course deeply considered all these things ever since they had known \nthat the Islamic Call would try to settle in Yathrib, and it was no surprise to discover \nthat they harboured the most enmity and hatred to Islam and the Messenger [pbuh] \n\n112\neven though they did not have the courage to uncover their feelings in the \nbeginning. \nThe following incident could attest clearly to that abominable antipathy that the Jews \nharboured towards the new political and religious changes that came to stamp the \nlife of Madinah. Ibn Ishaq, on the authority of the Mother of believers Safiyah [R]Ç \nnarrated: Safiyah, daughter of Huyayi bin Akhtab said: I was the closest child to my \nfather and my uncle Abi Yasir’s heart. Whenever they saw me with a child of theirs, \nthey should pamper me so tenderly to the exclusion of anyone else. However, with \nthe advent of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and setting in Quba’ with Bani ‘Amr bin \n‘Awf, my father, Huyayi bin Akhtab and my uncle Abu Yasir bin Akhtab went to see \nhim and did not return until sunset when they came back walking lazily and fully \ndejected. I, as usually, hurried to meet them smiling, but they would not turn to me \nfor the grief that caught them. I heard my uncle Abu Yasir say to Ubai and Huyayi: \n\"Is it really he (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh])?\" The former said: \"It is he, I swear by \nAllâh!\" \"Did you really recognize him?\" they asked. He answered: \"Yes, and my heart \nis burning with enmity towards him\"[Ibn Hisham 1/518, 519] \nAn interesting story that took place on the first day, the Prophet [pbuh] stepped in \nMadinah, could be quoted to illustrate the mental disturbance and deep anxiety that \nbeset the Jews. ‘Abdullah bin Salam, the most learned rabbi among the Jews came \nto see the Prophet [pbuh] when he arrived, and asked him certain questions to \nascertain his real Prophethood. No sooner did he hear the Prophet’s answers than he \nembraced Islam, but added that if his people knew of his Islamization they would \nadvance false arguments against me. The Prophet [pbuh] sent for some Jews and \nasked them about ‘Abdullah bin Salam, they testified to his scholarly aptitude and \nvirtuous standing. Here it was divulged to them that he had embraced Islam and on \nthe spot, they imparted categorically opposite testimonies and described him as the \nmost evil of all evils.

All of these efforts were exerted solely to provide \npeace, security, and prosperity to all mankind at large, and to bring about a spirit of \nrapport and harmony within his region, in particular. \nGeographically, the closest people to Madinah were the Jews. Whilst harbouring evil \nintentions, and nursing bitter grudge, they showed not the least resistance nor the \nslightest animosity. The Prophet decided to ratify a treaty with them with clauses \nthat provided full freedom in faith and wealth. He had no intention whatsoever of \nfollowing severe policies involving banishment, seizure of wealth and land or \nhostility. \nThe treaty came within the context of another one of a larger framework relating to \ninter-Muslim relationships. \nThe most important provisions of the treaty are the following: \n1. The Jews of Bani ‘Awf are one community with the believers. The Jews will \nprofess their religion, and the Muslims theirs. \n2. The Jews shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for \ntheirs. \n3. If attacked by a third party, each shall come to the assistance of the other. \n4. Each party shall hold counsel with the other. Mutual relation shall be founded \non righteousness; sin is totally excluded. \n5. Neither shall commit sins to the prejudice of the other. \n6.

The Prophet wanted to \nimpress upon the polytheists and Jews of Madinah as well as the bedouins in its \nvicinity, that the Muslims had smashed their old fears, and had been too strong to be \nattacked with impunity. He also wanted to display the power of his followers in order \nto deter Quraish from committing any military folly against him which might \n\n127\njeopardize their economic life and means of living, and to stop them from \npersecuting the helpless Muslims detained in Makkah, consequently he would avail \nhimself of this opportunity and resume his job of propagating the Divine Call freely. \nThe following is a resume of these missions and errands: \n1. Saif Al-Bahr Platoon sent in Ramadan 1 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. led by Hamzah bin \n‘Abdul Muttalib and comprising 30 Emigrants with a definite task of \nintercepting a caravan belonging to Quraish. It was a caravan of 300 people \nincluding Abu Jahl bin Hisham. The two parties encountered each other and \naligned in preparation for fighting. Majdi bin ‘Amr, on good terms with both \nsides, happened to be there and managed to prevent an imminent clash. \nOn that occasion, the Prophet [pbuh] accredited the first flag in the history of \nMuslims. It was white in colour and was entrusted to Kinaz bin Husain Al-\nGhanawi, to carry. \n2. In Shawwal, 1 A.H., i.e. April 623 A.D. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \ndespatched ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Harith bin Al-Muttalib at the head of 60 horsemen \nof Emigrants to a spot called Batn Rabegh where they encountered Abu \nSufyan at the head of a caravan of 200 men. There was arrow shooting but \nno actual fighting. \nIt is interesting to note that two Muslims, Al-Miqdad bin ‘Amr Al-Bahrani and \n‘Utbah bin Ghazwan Al-Mazini, defected from the caravan of Quraish and \njoined the ranks of ‘Ubaidah. The Muslims had a white flag carried by Mistah \nbin Athatha bin Al-Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf. \n3. In Dhul Qa‘dah 1 A.H., i.e. May 623 A.D. the Prophet [pbuh] despatched Sa‘d \nbin Abi Waqqas at the head of 20 horsemen, and instructed them not to go \nbeyond Al-Kharrar. After a five-day march they reached the spot to discover \nthat the camels of Quraish had left the day before; their flag, as usual, was \nwhite and carried by Al-Miqdad bin ‘Amr. \n4. Ghazwa Al-Abwa’ or Waddan. It was in Safar 2 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. The \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] set out himself at the head of 70 men, mostly \nEmigrants, to intercept a camel caravan belonging to Quraish, leaving behind \nSa‘d bin ‘Ubadah to dispose the affairs in Madinah. When he reached Waddan, \na place between Makkah and Madinah, he found none. \nIn the process of this campaign, he contracted a non-aggression pact with \n‘Amr bin Makhshi Ad-Damari. The provisions of the pact go as follows: \n\"This is a document from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh concerning Bani \nDamrah in which he established them safe and secure in their wealth and \nlives. They can expect support from the Muslims unless they oppose the \nreligion of Allâh. They are also expected to respond positively in case the \nProphet sought their help",

The \nProphet [pbuh], at the head of 200 companions, marched for Buwat to \nintercept a caravan belonging to Quraish comprising 100 Quraishites, Omaiya \nbin Khalaf among them, and 2500 camels. When he reached Buwat, the \ncaravan had left. Before leaving Madinah, he mandated Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh to \ndispose the affairs until his return. \n6. Safwan Invasion. In Rabi‘ Al-Awwal 2 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. Karz bin Jabir at the \nhead of a small group of polytheists raided the pastures of Madinah and \nlooted some animals. The Prophet [pbuh] at the head of 70 men left Madinah \nto fight the aggressors. He went in their pursuit till he reached a place called \nSafwan near Badr but could not catch up with them. This invasion came to be \nknown as the preliminary Badr Invasion. During his absence, the Prophet \n[pbuh] entrusted Zaid bin Harithah with the disposition of the affairs in \nMadinah. The standard was white in colour and entrusted to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib \nto carry. \n7. Dhil ‘Ushairah Invasion. It was in Jumada-al-Ula and Jumada-al-Akhirah the \nfirst or second 2 A.H., i.e. November-December 623 A.D. The Prophet [pbuh] \nat the head of 150-200 Muslim volunteers, with 30 camels which they rode \nturn by turn, set out to intercept a Quraishite caravan. He reached Dhil \n‘Ushairah but the camels had left some days before. These camels were the \nsame that he went out to intercept on their return from Syria, and were the \ndirect reason for the break out of the battle of Badr. In the process of this \ncampaign, the Prophet [pbuh] contracted a non-aggression pact with Bani \nMadlij and their allies Bani Dhumrah. Abu Salama bin ‘Abd Al-Asad Al-\nMakhzumi was mandated to rule Madinah in his absence. \n8. The Platoon of Nakhlah. It took place in Rajab 2 A.H., i.e. January 624 A.H. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] despatched ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh Asadi to \nNakhlah at the head of 12 Emigrants with six camels. ‘Abdullah was given a \nletter by the Prophet [pbuh] but was instructed to read it only after two days. \nHe followed the instructions and discovered that he was asked to go on to a \nplace called Nakhlah standing between Makkah and At-Ta’if, intercept a \ncaravan for Quraish and collect news about their intentions. He disclosed the \ncontents of the letters to his fellows who blindly obeyed the orders. At \nNakhlah, the caravan passed carrying loads of raisins (dried grapes), food \nstuff and other commodities. Notable polytheists were also there such as ‘Amr \nbin Al-Hadrami, ‘Uthman and Naufal, sons of ‘Abdullah bin Al-Mugheerah and \nothers... The Muslims held consultations among themselves with respect to \nfighting them taking into account Rajab which was a sacred month (during \nwhich, along with Dhul Hijja, Dhul Qa‘da and Muharram, war activities were \nsuspended as was the custom in Arabia then). At last they agreed to engage \nwith them in fighting. ‘Amr bin Al-Hadrami was shot dead by an arrow, \n‘Uthman and Al-Hakam were captured whereas Naufal escaped. They came \nback with the booty and the two prisoners. They set aside one-fifth of the \nbooty assigned to Allâh and His Messenger, and took the rest. The Messenger \ndisapproved of that act and suspended any action as regards the camels and \nthe two captives on account of the prohibited months already mentioned. The \npolytheists, on their part, exploited this golden opportunity to calumniate the \nMuslims and accuse them of violating what is Divinely inviolable. This idle talk \nbrought about a painful headache to Muhammad’s Companions, until at last \nthey were relieved when the Revelation came down giving a decisive answer \nand stating quite explicitly that the behaviour of the polytheists in the whole \n\n129\nprocess was much more heinous and far more serious than the act of the \nMuslims: \n\"They ask you concerning fighting in the sacred months (i.e. 1st, 7th, \n11th and 12th months of the Islamic calendar). Say, ‘Fighting therein \nis a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allâh is \nto prevent mankind from following the way of Allâh, to disbelieve in \nHim, to prevent access to Al-Masjid-Al-Harâm (at Makkah), and to \ndrive out its inhabitants, and Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.\" [Al-\nQur'an 2:217] \nThe Words of Allâh were quite clear and said that the tumult created by the \npolytheists was groundless. The sacred inviolable sanctities had been repeatedly \nviolated in the long process of fighting Islam and persecuting its adherents. The \nwealth of the Muslims as well as their homes had already been violated and their \nProphet [pbuh] had been the target of repeated attempts on his life. In short, that \nsort of propaganda could deservedly be described as impudence and prostitution",

    "content": "efore long, Allâh again sent the Muslims a different sort of verses whereby teaching \nthem ways of fighting, urging them to go to war and demonstrating relevant rules: \n\"So, when you meet (in fight - Jihâd in Allâh’s cause), those who disbelieve \nsmite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, \nthen bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is \nthe time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom \n(according to what benefits Islam), until the war lays down its burden. Thus \n[you are ordered by Allâh to continue in carrying out Jihâd against the \ndisbelievers till they embrace Islam (i.e. are saved from the punishment in \nthe Hell-fire) or at least come under your protection], but if it had been \nAllâh’s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). \nBut (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those \nwho are killed in the way of Allâh, He will never let their deeds be lost. He \nwill guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which \nHe has made known to them (i.e. they will know their places in Paradise \nmore than they used to know their houses in the world). O you who believe! \nIf you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold \nfirm.\" [Al-Qur'an 47:4-7][Tafheem\n-ul-Qur'an 5/11] \nShortly afterwards, Allâh began to dispraise the hypocrites, the weak at heart and \ncowardly elements: \n\"But when a decisive Sûrah (explaining and ordering things) is sent down, \nand fighting (Jihâd — the holy fighting) is mentioned (i.e. ordained) therein, \nyou will see those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you \nwith a look of one fainting to death. \" [Al-Qur'an 47:20] \nThe prevalent exigencies required as a top priority exhorting the Muslims to fight. \nAny leader with a deep insight would order his soldiers to get ready for any sort of \nemergency, let alone the All-Knowing Exalted Lord, Who is at all times omniscient of \nthe minutest details of affairs. The event of that skirmish with the polytheists dealt a \nheavy blow to the pride of Quraish and created a sort of horrible restlessness \namongst them. \nThe aforementioned Qur’ânic verses, enjoining the Muslims to strive in the cause of \nAllâh, betrayed the proximity of blood clashes that would be crowned by a decisive \nvictory for the Muslims, and final expulsion of polytheists out of the Sacred City, \nMakkah. They referred to rules pertinent to the treatment of captives and \nslaughtering the pagan soldiers till the war ended and laid down its burdens. All of \nthese could act as clues to a final triumph that would envelop the strife of the \nMuslims towards their noble objectives. \nAnother event of great significance featured the same month Sha‘ban 2 A.H., i.e. \nFebruary 624 A.D., which was a Divine injunction ordering that Al-Qiblah be changed \nfrom Jerusalem to the Sacred Mosque in Makkah. That was of a great advantage to \nthe Muslims at two levels. First, it brought about a kind of social sifting, so to speak, \nin terms of the hypocrites of the Jews and others weak at heart, and revealed their \ntrue nature and inclinations; the ranks of the Muslims were thereby purged from \nthose discord-prone elements. Second, facing a new Qiblah, the Sacred Mosque in \nMakkah, refers gently to a new role awaiting the Muslims to take up, and would start \n\n131\nonly after the repatriation of the Muslims to their Sacred City, Makkah for it is not \nlogical for the Muslims to leave their Qiblah at the mercy of non-Muslims. \nThe Muslims, therefore, at the behest of Allâh and on account of those Divine clues, \naugmented their activities and their tendency towards striving in the cause of Allâh \nand encountering His enemies in a decisive battle were greatly intensified. \n\n132\nThe Battle of Badr \nThe First Decisive Battle in the History of Islam \nReason of the Battle \nWe have already spoken about Al-‘Ushairah Invasion when a caravan belonging to \nQuraish had escaped an imminent military encounter with the Prophet [pbuh] and his \nmen. When their return from Syria approached, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched \nTalhah bin ‘Ubaidullâh and Sa‘id bin Zaid northward to scout around for any \nmovements of this sort. The two scouts stayed at Al-Hawra’ for some days until Abu \nSufyan, the leader of the caravan, passed by them. The two men hurried back to \nMadinah and reported to the Prophet [pbuh] their findings. Great wealth amounting \nto 50 thousand gold Dinars guarded by 40 men moving relatively close to Madinah \nconstituted a tempting target for the Muslim military, and provided a potentially \nheavy economic, political and military strike that was bound to shake the entire \nstructure of the Makkan polytheists. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] immediately exhorted the Muslims to rush out and waylay the \ncaravan to make up for their property and wealth they were forced to give up in \nMakkah. He did not give orders binding to everyone, but rather gave them full liberty \nto go out or stay back, thinking that it would be just an errand on a small scale. \nThe Muslim army was made up of 300-317 men, 82-86 Emigrants, 61 from Aws and \n170 from Khazraj. They were not well-equipped nor adequately prepared. They had \nonly two horses belonging to Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam and Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad \nAl-Kindi, 70 camels, one for two or three men to ride alternatively. The Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] himself, ‘Ali and Murthid bin Abi Murthid Al-Ghanawi had only one \ncamel. Disposition of the affairs of Madinah was entrusted to Ibn Umm Maktum but \nlater to Abu Lubabah bin ‘Abdul Mundhir. The general leadership was given to Mus‘ab \nbin ‘Umair Al-Qurashi Al-‘Abdari, and their standard was white in colour. The little \narmy was divided into two battalions, the Emigrants with a standard raised by ‘Ali \nbin Abi Talib, and the Helpers whose standard was in the hand of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh. \nAz-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam was appointed to the leadership of the right flank, Al-\nMiqdad bin ‘Amr to lead the left flank, and the rear of the army was at the command \nof Qais bin Abi",

He then turned left towards Badr and when he reached As-Safrâ’, \nhe despatched two men to scout about for the camels of Quraish. \nAbu Sufyan, on the other hand, was on the utmost alert. He had already been aware \nthat the route he was following was attended with dangers. He was also anxious to \nknow about the movements of Muhammad [pbuh].

The Muslims were afraid that the pagan Makkans would \nmarch on and start the war activities within the headquarters of Islam, Madinah. A \nmove of such nature would certainly damage and produce an infamous impact on the \ndignity and stance of the Muslims. \nOn account of the new grave developments, the Prophet [pbuh] held an advisory \nmilitary emergency meeting to review the ongoing situation and exchange \nviewpoints with the army leaders. Admittedly, some Muslims feared the horrible \nencounter and their courage began to waver; in this regard, Allâh says: \n\"As your Lord caused you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) to go out from your home \nwith the Truth, and verily, a party among the believers disliked it, disputing \nwith you concerning the Truth after it was made manifest, as if they were \nbeing driven to death while they were looking (at it).\" [Al-Qur'an 8:5, 6] \nThe Prophet [pbuh] apprised his men of the gravity of the situation and asked for \ntheir advice. Abu Bakr was the first who spoke on the occasion and assured the \nProphet [pbuh] of the unreserved obedience to his command. ‘Umar was the next to \nstand up and supported the views expressed by his noble friend. Then Al-Miqdad bin \n‘Amr got up and said: \"O Messenger of Allâh! Proceed where Allâh directs you to, for \nwe are with you. We will not say as the Children of Israel said to Moses [AWS]: \n\"Go you and your Lord and fight and we will stay here;\" \nRather we shall say: \n\"Go you and your Lord and fight and we will fight along with you.\" \nBy Allâh! If you were to take us to Bark Al-Ghimad, we will still fight resolutely with \nyou against its defenders until you gained it.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] thanked him and blessed him. \nThe three leaders who spoke were from the Emigrants, who only constituted a minor \nsection of the army. The Prophet [pbuh] wanted, and for the more reason, to hear \nthe Helpers’ view because they were the majority of the soldiers and were expected \nto shoulder the brunt of the war activities. Moreover, the clauses of Al-‘Aqabah \nPledge did not commit them to fighting beyond their territories. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] then said: \n\"Advise me my men!\" \n\n135\nby which he meant the Helpers, in particular. Upon this Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh stood up and \nsaid: \"By Allâh, I feel you want us (the Helpers) to speak.\" The Prophet [pbuh] \ndirectly said: \"Oh, yes!\" Sa‘d said: \"O Prophet of Allâh! We believe in you and we \nbear witness to what you have vouchsafed to us and we declare in unequivocal terms \nthat what you have brought is the Truth. We give you our firm pledge of obedience \nand sacrifice. We will obey you most willingly in whatever you command us, and by \nAllâh, Who has sent you with the Truth, if you were to ask us to plunge into the sea, \nwe will do that most readily and not a man of us will stay behind. We do not grudge \nthe idea of encounter with the enemy. We are experienced in war and we are \ntrustworthy in combat. We hope that Allâh will show you through our hands those \ndeeds of valour which will please your eyes. Kindly lead us to the battlefield in the \nName of Allâh.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] was impressed with the fidelity and the spirit of sacrifice which \nhis companions showed at this critical juncture. Then he said to them: \"Forward and \nbe of cheer, for Allâh has promised me one of the two (the lucrative course through \ncapturing the booty or strife in the cause of Allâh against the polytheists), and by \nAllâh it is as if I now saw the enemy lying prostrate.\" \nIn the immediate vicinity of Badr, the Prophet [pbuh] and his cavemate Abu Bakr \nconducted a scouting operation during which they managed to locate the camp of \nQuraish. They came across an old bedouin nearby whom they manipulated and \nmanaged to extract from him the exact location of the army of the polytheists. In the \nevening of the same day, he despatched three Emigrant leaders, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, \nAz-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam and Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas to scout about for news about the \nenemy. They saw two men drawing water for the Makkan army. On interrogation, \nthey admitted that they were water carriers working for Quraish. But that answer did \nnot please some Muslims and they beat the two boys severely in order to exact from \nthem an answer, even if it isn’t true, alluding to the caravan laden with wealth. The \ntwo boys thus lied, and so they were released. The Prophet [pbuh] was angry with \nthose men and censured them saying: \"On telling the truth, you beat them, and on \ntelling a lie, you released them!\" He then addressed the two boys and after a little \nconversation with them he learned a lot about the enemy: number of soldiers, their \nexact location and names of some of their notables. \nHe then turned to the Muslims and said: \"Hearken, Quraish has sent you their most \nprecious lives.\" \nThe same night it rained on both sides. For the polytheists it obstructed further \nprogress, whereas it was a blessing for the Muslims. It cleaned them and removed \nfrom them the stain of Satan. Allâh sent rain to strengthen their hearts and to plant \ntheir feet firmly therewith. They marched a little forward and encamped at the \nfarther bank of the valley. Muhammad [pbuh] stopped at the nearest spring of Badr. \nAl-Hubab bin Mundhir asked him, \"Has Allâh inspired you to choose this very spot or \nis it stratagem of war and the product of consultation?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied \n\"It is stratagem of war and consultation.\" Al-Hubab said: \"This place is no good; let \nus go and encamp on the nearest water well and make a basin or reservoir full of \nwater, then destroy all the other wells so that they will be deprived of the water",

In case of defeat, the Prophet \n[pbuh] would not be harmed and he could go back to Madinah where there were \nmore people who loved him and who would have come for help if they had known \nthat he was in that difficult situation, so that he would resume his job, hold counsel \nwith them and they would strive in the cause of Allâh with him again and again. \nA squad of guards was also chosen from amongst the Helpers under the leadership \nof the same man, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, in order to defend the Prophet [pbuh] in his \nheadquarters. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] spent the whole night preceding the day of the battle in prayer \nand supplication. The Muslim army, wearied with their long march, enjoyed sound \nand refreshing sleep, a mark of the Divine favour and of the state of their \nundisturbed minds. \n\"(Remember) when He covered you with a slumber as a security from Him, \nand He caused rain to descend on you from the sky, to clean you thereby \nand to remove from you the Rijz (whispering, evil suggestions, etc.) of \nSatan, and to strengthen your hearts, and make your feet firm thereby.\" [Al-\nQur'an 8:11] \nThat was Friday night, Ramadan 17th., the year 2 A.H. \nIn the morning, the Prophet [pbuh] called his men to offer the prayers and then \nurged them to fight in the way of Allâh.

A few of them approached, in a provocative deed, to draw water \nfrom the wells of Badr, but were all shot dead except one, Hakeem bin Hizam, who \nlater became a devoted Muslim. ‘Umair bin Wahab Al-Jumahi, in an attempt to \nreconnoiter the power of the Muslims, made a scouting errand and submitted a \nreport saying that the Muslim army numbered as many as 300 men keen on fighting \nto the last man.

I beseech You Allâh to defeat them (the \n\n137\nenemies).\" He also gave strict orders that his men would not start fighting until he \ngave them his final word. He recommended that they use their arrows sparingly[Sahih \nAl-Bukhari 2/568] and never resort to sword unless the enemies came too close.[Abu Da'ud \n2/13] \nAbu Jahl also prayed for victory, saying: \"Our Lord, whichever of the two parties was \nless kind to his relatives, and brought us what we do not know, then destroy him \ntomorrow.\". They were confident that their superior number, equipment and \nexperience would be decisive. The Noble Qur’ân, with a play on the word, told them \nthat the decision had come, and the victory — but not in the sense they had hoped \nfor: \n\"(O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgement, now has the judgement come \nunto you and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you, and if you \nreturn (to the attack), so shall we return, and your forces will be of no avail \nto you, however numerous it be, and verily, Allâh is with the believers.\" [Al-\nQur'an 8:19] \nThe first disbeliever to trigger the fire of the battle and be its first victim was Al-\nAswad bin ‘Abdul Asad Al-Makhzumi, a fierce bad-tempered idolater. He stepped out \nswearing he would drink from the water basin of the Muslims, otherwise, destroy it \nor die for it. He engaged with Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, who struck his leg with his \nsword and dealt him another blow that finished him off inside the basin. \nThe battle had actually started. Protected by armour and shields, ‘Utbah bin Rabi‘a \nstepped forth between his brother Shaibah and his son Al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah from \nthe lines of Quraish and hurled maledictions at the Muslims. Three young men of the \nHelpers came out against them: ‘Awf and Mu‘wwadh — the sons of Harith, and \n‘Abdullah bin Rawaha. But the Makkans yelled that they had nothing to do with \nthem. They wanted the heads of their cousins. Upon this the Prophet [pbuh] asked \n‘Ubaidah bin Al-Harith, Hamzah — his uncle, and his cousin ‘Ali [R] to go forward for \nthe combat. The three duels were rapid. Hamzah killed Shaibah, while ‘Ali killed Al-\nWaleed.[Mishkat 2/343] ‘Ubaidah was seriously wounded but, before he fell, Hamzah fell \nupon ‘Utbah and with a sweep of his sword, cut off his head. ‘Ali and Hamzah carried \n‘Ubaidah back with his leg cut off. He died four or five days later of a disease in the \nbile duct. \n‘Ali was possessed of a deep conviction that Allâh’s Words were revealed: \n\"These two opponents (believers and disbelievers) dispute with each other \nabout their Lord.\" [Al-Qur'an 22:19] \nThese verses were revealed in connection with men of Faith who confess their Lord \nand seek to carry out His Will (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers at Badr Battle), \nand men who deny their Lord and defy Him (the people of Quraish). \nThe duel was followed by a few more duels but the Makkans suffered terrible defeats \nin all the combats and lost some of their most precious lives. They were too much \nexasperated and enraged and fell upon the Muslims to exterminate them once and \nfor all. The Muslims, however, after supplicating their Lord, calling upon Him for \nassistance, were made to hold to their position and conduct a defensive war plan \nthat was successful enough to inflict heavy losses on the attackers. The Prophet \n\n138\n[pbuh] used to pray to his Lord ceaselessly persistently and day and night to come to \ntheir succour. When the fierce engagement grew too hot he again began to \nsupplicate his Lord saying: \n\"O Allâh! Should this group (of Muslims) be defeated today, You will no \nlonger be worshipped.\" \nHe continued to call out to his Lord, stretching forth his hands and facing Al-Qiblah, \nuntil his cloak fell off his shoulders. Then Abu Bakr came, picked up the cloak, and \nput it back on his shoulders and said: \"O Prophet of Allâh, you have cried out enough \nto your Lord. He will surely fulfill what He has promised you.\" \nImmediate was the response from Allâh, Who sent down angels from the heavens for \nthe help and assistance of the Prophet [pbuh] and his companions. The Noble Qur’ân \nobserves: \n\"Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast \nterror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved.\" [Al-Qur'an 8:12] \nAllâh, the All-Mighty, also inspired another message to His Messenger, saying: \n\"I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other \n(following one another) in succession.\" [Al-Qur'an 8:9] \nThe Prophet [pbuh], in his trellis, dozed off a little and then raised his head joyfully \ncrying: \n\"O Abu Bakr, glad tidings are there for you: Allâh’s victory has approached, \nby Allâh, I can see Gabriel on his mare in the thick of a sandstorm.\" \nHe then jumped out crying: \n\"Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.\" [Al-\nQur'an 54:45] \nAt the instance of Gabriel, the Prophet [pbuh] took a handful of gravel, cast it at the \nenemy and said: \"Confusion seize their faces!\" As",

I will cast \nterror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved.\" [Al-Qur'an 8:12] \nAllâh, the All-Mighty, also inspired another message to His Messenger, saying: \n\"I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other \n(following one another) in succession.\" [Al-Qur'an 8:9] \nThe Prophet [pbuh], in his trellis, dozed off a little and then raised his head joyfully \ncrying: \n\"O Abu Bakr, glad tidings are there for you: Allâh’s victory has approached, \nby Allâh, I can see Gabriel on his mare in the thick of a sandstorm.\" \nHe then jumped out crying: \n\"Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.\" [Al-\nQur'an 54:45] \nAt the instance of Gabriel, the Prophet [pbuh] took a handful of gravel, cast it at the \nenemy and said: \"Confusion seize their faces!\" As",

He was commanding \nthe army, inspiring confidence among his men and exhorting them to fight manfully \nfor the sake of their Lord, reciting the Words of Allâh: \n\"And be quick for forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as \nare the heavens and the earth.\" [Al-Qur'an 3:133] \n\n139\nThe spirit he infused into his men was clearly witnessed by the valour of ‘Umair, a \nlad of sixteen, who flung away some dates he was eating crying out: \"These (the \ndates) are holding me back from Paradise.\" So saying he plunged into the thick of \nthe battle and died fighting bravely. Unique deeds of valour, deep devotion and full \nobedience to the Prophet [pbuh] were exhibited in the process of the battle. The \narmy of the faithfuls was borne forward by the power of enthusiasm which the half-\nhearted warriors of Makkah miserably lacked. A large number of the polytheists were \nkilled and the others began to waver. No wonder! The standard-bearers of Truth \nwere given immediate help, and supernatural agencies (the angels), were sent to \ntheir assistance by their Lord to help them defeat the forces of evil. \nThe records of Hadith speak eloquently of the fact that the angels did appear on that \nday and fought on the side of the Muslims. Ibn ‘Abbas said: \"While on that day a \nMuslim was chasing a disbeliever and he heard over him the swashing of a whip and \nthe voice of the rider saying: ‘Go ahead Haizum’. He glanced at the polytheist who \nhad (now) fallen down on his back. The Helper came to the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] and related that event to him. The Prophet [pbuh] replied: ‘You have told the \ntruth. This was the help from the third heaven.\"[Sahih Muslim 2/93] \nOne of the Helpers captured ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, who said: \"O Messenger of \nAllâh, by Allâh this man did not capture me. I was captured by a man who was bald \nand had the most handsome face, and who was riding a piebald horse, I cannot see \nhim here among the people.\" The Helper interrupted: \"I captured him, O Messenger \nof Allâh.\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied: \n\"Be quiet, Allâh the All-Mighty strengthened you with the help of a noble \nangel.\" \nIblîs, the archsatan, in the guise of Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju‘sham Al-Mudlaji, on \nseeing angels working in favour of the Muslims, and Quraish rapidly losing ground on \nthe battlefield, made a quick retreat despite the polytheists’ pleas to stay on. He ran \noff and plunged into the sea. \nThe ranks of Quraish began to give way and their numbers added nothing but \nconfusion. The Muslims followed eagerly their retreating steps, slaying or taking \ncaptive all that fell within their reach. Retreat soon turned into ignominious rout; and \nthey flied in haste, casting away their armour, abandoned beasts of burden, camp \nand equipage. \nThe great tyrant Abu Jahl, however, on seeing the adverse course of the battle, tried \nto stop the tidal wave of the Islamic victory by nerving the polytheists and \nencouraging them by all means available and adjuring them by Al-Lat and ‘Uzza and \nall symbols of paganism to stand firm in place and retaliate against the Muslims, but \nto no avail. Their morale had already been drastically reduced to zero, and their lines \nbroken down. He then began to realize the reality of his arrogance and haughtiness. \nNone remained around him except a gang of doomed polytheists whose resistance \nwas also quelled by an Islamic irresistible storm of true devotion-based valour and \nIslam-orientated pursuit of martyrdom. Abu Jahl was deserted and left by himself on \nhis horse waiting for death at the hand of two courageous lads of the Helpers. \n‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf related the following interesting story in this regard: I was \nin the thick of the battle when two youths, still seemingly inexperienced in the art of \n\n140\nfighting, one on the right and the second on the left. One of them spoke in a secret \nvoice asking me to show him Abu Jahl. I asked about his intention, to which he \nreplied, that he had a strong desire to engage with him in a combat until either of \nthem was killed. It was something incredible to me. I turned left and the other said \nsomething to the same effect and showed a similar desire. I acceded to their earnest \npleas and pointed directly at their target. They both rushed swiftly towards the spot, \nand without a moment’s hesitation struck him simultaneously with their swords and \nfinished him off. They went back to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], each claiming \nthat he had killed Abu Jahl to the exclusion of the other. The Prophet [pbuh] asked if \nthey had wiped the blood off their swords and they answered that they had not. He \nthen examined both swords and assured them that they both had killed him. When \nthe battle concluded, Abu Jahl’s spoils were given to Mu‘adh bin ‘Amr bin Al-Jumuh, \nbecause the other Mu‘awwadh bin Al-‘Afrâ’[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/444,2/568; Mishkat 2/352] was \nlater killed in the course of the same battle. At the termination of the battle, the \nProphet [pbuh] wanted to look for this archenemy of Islam, Abu Jahl. ‘Abdullah bin \nMas‘ud found him on the verge of death breathing his last. He stepped on his neck \naddressing him: \"Have you seen how Allâh has disgraced you?\" The enemy of Islam \nstill defiantly answered: \"I am not disgraced. I am no more than a man killed by his \nown people on the battlefield.\" And then inquired \"Who has won the battle?\" Ibn \nMas‘ud replied \"Allâh and His Messenger.\" Abu Jahl then said with a heart full of \ngrudge \"You have followed difficult ways, you shepherd!\" Ibn Mas‘ud used to be a \nshepherd working for the Makkan aristocrats. \nIbn Mas‘ud then cut off his head and took it to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who, \non seeing it, began to entertain Allâh’s praise: \n\"Allâh is Great, praise is to Allâh, Who has fulfilled His Promise, assisted His \nservant and defeated the confederates alone.\" \nHe then se",

The Prophet [pbuh] advised his companions to preserve the lives of Banu \nHashim who had gone out to Badr with the polytheists unwillingly because \nthey had feared the censure of their people. Among them, he named Al-\n‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib and Abu Bukhtari bin Hisham. He ordered the \nMuslims to capture, but not to kill them. Abu Hudhaifah bin ‘Utbah showed \ngreat surprise and commented saying: \"We kill our fathers, children, brothers \nand members of our clan, and then come to spare Al-‘Abbas? By Allâh! If I \nsee him I will surely strike him with my sword.\" On hearing these words, the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], addressing ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, said \"Is it fair \nthat the face of the Messenger’s uncle be struck with sword?\" ‘Umar got \nindignant and threatened to kill Abu Hudhaifah; the latter later said that \nextreme fear had taken firm grip of him and felt that nothing except \nmartyrdom could expiate for his mistake. He was actually killed later on \nduring Al-Yamamah events. \n2. Abu Al-Bukhtari bin Hisham had already done his best to restrain his people, \nthe Makkans, from committing any act of folly against the Prophet [pbuh] \n\n141\nwhile the latter was still in Makkah. He also neither hurt nor was reported to \nhave uttered anything repugnant with regard to the Prophet [pbuh]. He had \nas well been among the people who tried to invalidate the boycott alliance \ntaken against Banu Hashim and Banu ‘Abdul Muttalib. \nHere, however, in the battle of Badr he insisted on fighting unless his \ncompatriot was spared. Al-Mujdhir bin Ziyad Al-Balwi, with whom he was \nengaged in combat, replied that the other was not included in the Prophet \n[pbuh]’s recommendation. The combat went on to end in Al-Bukhtari’s death. \n3. ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf and Omaiyah bin Khalaf had been close friends \nduring the pre-Islamic era. When the battle of Badr ended, ‘Abdur-Rahman \nsaw Omaiyah and his son among the captives. He threw away the armour he \nhad as spoils, and walked with them both. Bilal, the Prophet [pbuh]’s caller \nfor prayer, saw Omaiyah and soon all the torture he had been put to at the \nhand of this man dawned upon him, and swore he would have revenge on \nOmaiyah. ‘Abdur-Rahman tried to ease the tension and address embarrassing \nsituation amicably but with no success. The Muslims gathered around and \nstruck Omaiyah’s son with swords. At this point, ‘Abdur-Rahman called upon \nhis old friend to run for his life but he was put to swords from different people \nand lay down dead. ‘Abdur-Rahman, completely helpless and resigned said: \nMay Allâh have mercy on Bilal, for he deprived me of the spoils, and I have \nbeen stricken by the death of my two captives. \n4. On the moral level, the battle of Badr was an inescapable conflict between the \nforces of good and those of evil. In this context, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab did not \nspare the life of any polytheist even his uncle on the maternal side Al-‘As bin \nHisham bin Al-Mugheerah. \n5. Abu Bakr shouted at his son ‘Abdur-Rahman, still a polytheist and fighting \nwith them, \"Where is my wealth, you wicked boy?\" The son answered that it \nwas gone with the wind. \n6. When the battle ended, the Muslims began to hold some polytheists in \ncaptivity. The Prophet [pbuh] looked into the face of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, the \nHead of the Prophet [pbuh]’s guards, and understood that he was hateful to \ntaking the enemy elements as prisoners. Sa‘d agreed to what the Prophet \n[pbuh] said and added that it was the first victory for the Muslims over the \nforces of polytheism, and he had more liking for slaying them than sparing \ntheir lives. \n7. On the day of Badr, the sword of ‘Ukashah bin Mihsan Al-Asdi broke down so \nthe Prophet [pbuh] gave him a log of wood which he shook and it \nimmediately turned into a long strong white sword. ‘Ukashah went on using \nthat same sword in most of the Islamic conquests until he died in the process \nof the apostasy wars. \n8. When the war activities had been concluded, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair Al-‘Abdari saw \nhis brother, still a polytheist, being handcuffed by a Ansari. Mus‘ab \nrecommended that the Helper tighten the knot for the prisoner’s mother was \nwealthy enough to ransom her son. ‘Abu ‘Aziz, Mus‘ab’s brother, tried to \nappeal to his brother through the family ties, but the latter firmly replied that \nthe Helper was more eligible for brotherhood than him. \n9. When the Prophet [pbuh] ordered that the corpses of the polytheists be \ndropped into an empty well, Abu Hudhaifah bin ‘Utbah looked sadly at his \ndead father, who fought on the side of the polytheists. The Prophet [pbuh] \n\n142\nnoticed that and asked him about it. Hudhaifah said that he had never held \nthe least doubt that his father met his fate deservedly, but added that he \nwished he had been guided to the path of Islam, and that is why he felt sad. \nThe Prop",

    "content": "to convey the glad tidings of victory to the Muslims there. \nThe multi-ethnic and ideological structure of Madinah featured different respective \nreactions. Rumour-mongers amongst the Jews and hypocrites spread news to the \neffect that the Prophet [pbuh] had been killed, and tried to impress their false \nassumption on the fact that Zaid bin Harithah was riding Al-Qaswâ’, the Prophet \n[pbuh]’s she-camel. Having reached, the two messengers imparted to the Muslims \nthe happy news of victory, and furnished accurate information about the course of \nevents in order to establish the sense of reassurance deep in the hearts of the \nanxious, but now, joyous Muslims. They immediately started acclaiming Allâh’s Name \nand entertaining His praise at the top of their voices. Their chiefs went out of the city \nto wait and receive the Prophet [pbuh] on the road leading to Badr. \nUsamah bin Zaid related that they received the news of the manifest victory shortly \nafter Ruqaiyah, the Prophet [pbuh]’s daughter, and the wife of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan \nhad been committed to earth. She had been terminally ill and the Prophet [pbuh] \nhad asked ‘Uthman to stay in Madinah and look after her. \nBefore leaving the scene of the battle, dispute concerning the spoils of war arose \namong the Muslim warriors, as the rule relating to their distribution had not yet been \nlegislated. When the difference grew wider, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nsuspended any solution whereof until the Revelation was sent down. \n‘Ubadah bin As-Samit said: \"We went out with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and I \nwitnessed Badr with him. The battle started and Allâh, the Exalted, defeated the \nenemy. Some of the Muslims sought and pursued the enemy, some were intent on \ncollecting the spoils from the enemy camp, and others were guarding the Messenger \nof Allâh [pbuh] and were on the alert for any emergency or surprise attack. When \nnight came and the Muslims gathered together, those who had collected the booty \nsaid: \"We collected it, so no one else has any right to it.\" Those who had pursued the \nenemy said: \"You do not have more right to it than we do; we held the enemy at bay \nand then defeated them.\" As for the men who had been guarding the Prophet \n[pbuh], they also made similar claims to the spoils. \nAt that very time, a Qur’ânic verse was revealed saying: \n\"They ask you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) about the spoils of war. Say: ‘The \nspoils are for Allâh and the Messenger.’ So fear Allâh and adjust all matters \nof difference among you, and obey Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad \n[pbuh]), if you are believers.\" [Al-Qur'an 8:1] \nOn their way back to Madinah, at a large sand hill, the Prophet [pbuh] divided the \nspoils equally among the fighters after he had taken Al-Khums (one-fifth). When \nthey reached As-Safra’, he ordered that two of the prisoners should be killed. They \nwere An-Nadr bin Al-Harith and ‘Uqbah bin Abi Muait, because they had persecuted \n\n144\nthe Muslims in Makkah, and harboured deep hatred towards Allâh and His Messenger \n[pbuh]. In a nutshell, they were criminals of war in modern terminology, and their \nexecution was an awesome lesson to oppressors. ‘Uqbah forgot his pride and cried \nout, \"Who will look after my children O Messenger of Allâh?\" The Prophet [pbuh] \nanswered, \"The fire (of Hell).[Sunan Abu Da'ud with 'Aun-ul-Ma'bood 3/12]\" Did ‘Uqbah not \nremember the day when he had thrown the entrails of a sheep onto the head of the \nProphet [pbuh] while he was prostrating himself in prayer, and Fatimah had come \nand washed it off him? He had also strangled the Prophet [pbuh] with his cloak if it \nhad not been for Abu Bakr to intervene and release the Prophet [pbuh]. The heads of \nboth criminals were struck off by ‘Ali bin Abi Talib. \nAt Ar-Rawhâ’, a suburb of Madinah, the Muslim army was received by the joyous \nMadinese who had come to congratulate the Prophet [pbuh] on the manifest victory \nthat Allâh had granted him. Usaid bin Hudair, acting as a mouthpiece of the other \ntrue believers, after entertaining Allâh’s praise, he excused himself for not having \njoined them on grounds that the Prophet [pbuh]’s intention was presumably, an \nerrand aiming to intercept a caravan of camels only, he added that if it had occurred \nto him that it would be real war, he would have never tarried. The Prophet [pbuh] \nassured Usaid that he had believed him. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] now entered Madinah as a man to be counted for in a new \ndimension — the military field. In consequence, a large number of the people of \nMadinah embraced Islam, which added a lot to the strength, power and moral \nstanding of the true religion. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] exhorted the Muslims to treat the prisoners so well to such an \nextent that the captors used to give the captives their bread (the more valued part \nof the meal) and keep the dates for themselves. \nPrisoners of war constituted a problem awaiting resolution because it was a new \nphenomenon in the history of Islam. The Prophet [pbuh] consulted Abu Bakr and \n‘Umar bin Al-Khattab as to what he should do with the prisoners. Abu Bakr \nsuggested that he should ransom them, explaining this by saying: \"They are after all \nour relatives, and this money would give us strength against the disbelievers, \nmoreover, Allâh could guide them to Islam.\" ‘Umar advised killing them, saying, \n\"They are the leaders of Kufr (disbelief).\" The Prophet [pbuh] preferred Abu Bakr’s \nsuggestion to that of ‘Umar’s. The following day, ‘Umar called on the Prophet [pbuh] \nand Abu Bakr to see them weeping. He showed extreme astonishment and inquired \nabout the situation so that he might weep if it was worth weeping for, or else he \nwould feign weeping. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] said that a Qur’ânic verse had been revealed rebuking them for \ntaking ransom from the captives rather than slaying them: \n\"It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them \nwith ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in \nthe land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for \nfreeing the captives), but Allâh desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allâh is \nAll-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allâh, a severe \ntorment would have touched you for what you took.\" [Al-Qur'an 8:67,68] \nThe previous Divine ordainment went as follows, \n\n145\n\"Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without \nransom) or ransom.\" [Al-Qur'an 47:4] \nWhich included an area providing permission to take ransom, that is why no penalty \nwas imposed. They were rebuked only for taking prisoners before subduing all the \nland of disbelief. Apart from this, the polytheists taken to Madinah were not only \nprisoners of war but rather archcriminals of war whom modern war penal law brings \nto justice to receive their due sentence of death or prison for life. \nThe ransom for the prisoners ranged between 4000 and 1000 Dirhams in accordance \nwith the captive’s financial situation. Another form of ransom assumed an \neducational dimension; most of the Makkans, unlike the Madinese, were literate and \nso each prisoner who could not afford the ransom was entrusted with ten children to \nteach them the art of writing and reading. Once the child had been proficient \nenough, the instructor would be set free. Another clan of prisoners were released \nunransomed on grounds of being hard up. Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet \n[pbuh], paid the ransom of her husband Abul-‘As with a necklace. The Muslims \nreleased her prisoner and returned the necklace in deference to the Prophet [pbuh] \nbut on condition that Abul-‘As allow Zainab to migrate to Madinah, which he actually \ndid. \nIn captivity, there was also an eloquent orator called Suhail bin ‘Amr. ‘Umar \nsuggested that they pull out his front teeth to disable him from speaking, but the \nProphet [pbuh] turned down his suggestion for fear Quraish should retaliate in the \nsame manner on one hand, and on the other for fear of Allâh’s wrath on the Day of \nResurrection. \nSa‘d bin An-Nu",

He was very careful to abide by it to the letter and the Muslims did not show \nthe least violation of any of its provisions. The Jews, however, whose natural \ndisposition is closely linked to treachery, betrayal and covenant-breaching, could not \nrid themselves of the tradition of theirs, and started a process of intrigues and \ntroublemaking with the aim of producing schism in the growing solid Muslim ranks. \nHere is a relevant model of their behaviour: Shas bin Qais, an elderly Jew, a terrible \ndisbeliever and a greatly envious man of the Muslims, passed by a group of \n\n149\nMuhammad [pbuh]’s followers of Aws and Khazraj. He perceived a prevalent spirit of \nreconciliation and an atmosphere of rapport and amity enveloping the whole group; \nan unusual scene categorically in conflict with the animosity and hatred that \ncharacterized their pre-Islam behaviour. He, therefore, sent a youth of his to sit \namong them, remind them of Bu‘ath war between them and recite some of their \nverses which they used to compose satirizing each other; all of this with the \nintention of sowing the seeds of discord and disagreement and undermining the new \nIslamically-orientated inter-tribal relations. The youth did in fact succeed and the two \nparties at no time recalled the old days and pre-Islam tribal fanaticism sprang to the \nfront to bring about a state of war. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] was reported of this account, and immediately, at the head of \nsome Emigrants, set out to see to the situation. He began to rebuke them but in the \nmanner of the great instructor and the tolerant spirit of the understanding guide: \"O, \nMuslims! Do you still advance pre-Islamic arguments after I have been sent to you \n(as a Messenger). Remember that it is not rightful for you to turn backward after \nAllâh has guided you to the Straight Path, delivered you from disbelief and created \namity between you.\" The Muslims readily realized that it was a Satanic whim and a \nplot hatched by the enemies. They directly embraced each other and went back \nhome quite satisfied and in full obedience to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].[Ibn Hisham \n1/555, 556] \nSuch were the practices of the Jews, trouble-making, dissension-sowing, falsehood-\nfabrication, faking belief in the day, and practising disbelief at night. In everyday life, \nthey used to tighten the ropes of financial dealings on the Muslims. If they happened \nto owe a Muslim something, they would shirk their obligations on grounds that he \nhad converted into a new religion and they would allege the basis of agreement was \nno longer valid. If it was the other way, they would never cease to harass him day \nand night to pay back the debt, all of which in a desperate attempt to demolish the \ngreat edifice of the new religion that was rapidly gaining ground and speedily \ntowering up skyward. \nThe Qainuqa‘ Jews breach the Covenant \nSeeing that Allâh sided with the believers and granted them a manifest victory and \nperceiving the Muslims’ awesome presence in Madinah, the Jews could no longer \ncontain themselves or conceal indignation. They started a series of provocative and \nharmful deeds publicly. The most wicked amongst them were the tribe of Banu \nQainuqa‘, who lived in quarters within Madinah named after them. As for jobs, they \ntook up goldsmithery, blacksmithing and crafts of making household instruments, \nthat is why war weaponry was available in large quantities in their houses. They \ncounted 700 warriors, and were the most daring amongst the Jewish community in \nArabia, and now the first to breach the covenant of cooperation and non-aggression \nwhich they had already countersigned with the Prophet [pbuh]. Their behaviour grew \ntoo impolite and unbearable. They started a process of trouble-making, jeering at \nthe Muslims, hurting those who frequented their bazaars, and even intimidating their \nwomen. Such things began to aggravate the general situation, so the Prophet [pbuh] \ngathered them in assemblage, admonished and called them to be rational, sensible \nand guided and cautioned against further transgression. Nevertheless they remained \nobdurate and paid no heed to his warning, and said: \"Don’t be deluded on account of \ndefeating some Quraishites inexperienced in the art of war. If you were to engage us \nin fight, you will realize that we are genuine war experts.\" \n\n150\nIn this regard, the Words of Allâh were revealed saying: \n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh] ) to those who disbelieve: ‘You will be defeated \nand gathered together to Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest.’ There \nhas already been a Sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in \ncombat — i.e. the battle of Badr): One was fighting in the cause of Allâh, and \nas for the other (they) were disbelievers. They (the believers) saw them \n(the disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they \nwere thrice their number). And Allâh supports with His Victory whom He \npleases. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand.\" [Al-Qur'an \n3:12,13] [Sunan Abu Da'ud with Aunul-Ma'bood 3/115; Ibn Hisham 1/552] \nThe answer of Banu Qainuqa‘ amounted, as seen, to war declaration. The Prophet \n[pbuh] suppressed his anger and advised the Muslims to be patient and forbearing \nand wait for what time might reveal. \nThe Jews, went too far in their transgression, presumptuous behaviour and licentious \npractices. One day a Jewish goldsmith provoked a Muslim woman whose genitals \nbecome uncovered when he had tied the edge of the garment to her back. A Muslim \nman happened to be there and killed the man; the Jews retaliated by killing that \nMuslim. The man’s family called the Muslims for help and war started.[Ibn Hisham 2/47,48] \nOn Saturday, Shawwal 15th, 2 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] marched out with his \nsoldiers, Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, carrying the standard of the Muslims and laid \nsiege to the Jews’ forts for 15 days.

    "content": "l-Ashraf, killed \nKa‘b bin Al-Ashraf was the most resentful Jew at Islam and the Muslims, the keenest \non inflicting harm on the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and the most zealous advocate \nof waging war against him. He belonged to Tai’ tribe but his mother to Banu Nadeer. \nHe was a wealthy man known for his handsomeness, and a poet living in luxury in \nhis fort south east of Madinah at the rear of Banu Nadeer’s habitations. \nOn hearing the news of Badr, he got terribly exasperated and swore that he would \nprefer death to life if the news was true. When this was confirmed he wrote poems \nsatirizing Muhammad [pbuh], eulogizing Quraish and enticing them against the \nProphet [pbuh]. He then rode to Makkah where he started to trigger the fire of war, \nand kindle rancour against the Muslims in Madinah. When Abu Sufyan asked him \nwhich religion he was more inclined to, the religion of the Makkans or that of \nMuhammad [pbuh] and his companions, he replied that the pagans were better \nguided. With respect to this situation, Allâh revealed His Words: \n\"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They \nbelieve in Jibt and Taghût, and say to the disbelievers that they are better \nguided as regards the way than the believers (Muslims).\" [Al-Qur'an 4:51] \nHe then returned to Madinah to start a fresh campaign of slanderous propaganda \nthat took the form of obscene songs and amatory sonnets with a view to defaming \nthe Muslim women. \n\n152\nAt this stage, the situation became unbearable and could no longer be put up with. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] gathered his men and said: \"Who will kill Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf? He \nhad maligned Allâh, and His Messenger.\" Thereupon, Muhammad bin Maslamah, \n‘Abbad bin Bishr, Al-Harith bin Aws, Abu ‘Abs bin Hibr and Salkan bin Salamah, \nKa‘b’s foster brother, volunteered to do the job. \nMuhammad bin Maslamah said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, do you wish that I should kill \nhim?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit).\" He \nsaid: \"Talk (as you like).\" So, Muhammad bin Maslamah came to Ka‘b and talked to \nhim, saying: \"This man (i.e. the Prophet [pbuh]) has made up his mind to collect \ncharity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship.\" When he heard this, Ka‘b \nsaid: \"By Allâh you will be put to more trouble by him.\" Muhammad bin Maslamah \nanswered: \"No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to \nforsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give \nme a loan.\" He said: \"What will you mortgage?\" Muhammad answered: \"What do you \nwant?\" The immoral and heartless Jew demanded women and children as articles of \nsecurity against the debt. Muhammad said: \"Should we pledge our women whereas \nyou are the most handsome of the Arabs; and the son of one of us may be abused \nby saying that he was pledged for two wasq (measurement unit of weight) of dates \nbut we can pledge you (our) weapons.\" Ka‘b agreed. Salkan bin Salamah, Abu \nNa’ilah, at another time, went to see Ka‘b for the same purpose and there were more \nor less the same subjects, only that Abu Na’ilah would bring him some companions. \nThe plan was successful and provided for the presence of both men and weapons. On \nRabi‘ Al-Awwal 14th, at night, the year 3 A.H. the people said good bye to the \nProphet [pbuh] and set out in the Name of Allâh to implement the carefully drawn \nplan. The Prophet [pbuh] stayed back praying for them and supplicating Allâh to \nrender them success. The men went and called upon him at night. He came down \nalthough his wife warned him not to meet them alleging that: \"I hear a voice which \nsounds like the voice of murder.\" He said: \"It is only Muhammad bin Maslamah and \nmy foster brother Abu Na’ilah. When a gentleman is called at night even if he be \npierced with a spear, he should respond to the call.\" Abu Na’ilah said to his \ncompanions: \"As he comes down, I will extend my hand towards his head to smell \nand when I hold him fast, you should do your job.\" So when he came down, they \ntalked together for about an hour. They then invited him to go out and spend a nice \ntime in the moonlight. On the way out, Abu Na’ilah remarked: \"I smell the nicest \nperfume from you.\" Ka‘b said: \"Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most \nscented of the women of Arabia.\" Abu Na’ilah again said: \"Allow me to smell (the \nscent on your head)\". He said: \"Yes, you may smell.\" So he caught it and smelt. \nThen he said: \"Allow me to do so(once again).\" He then held his head fast and said \nto his companions: \"Do your job.\" And they killed him.

    "enhanced_text": "l-Ashraf, killed \nKa‘b bin Al-Ashraf was the most resentful Jew at Islam and the Muslims, the keenest \non inflicting harm on the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and the most zealous advocate \nof waging war against him. He belonged to Tai’ tribe but his mother to Banu Nadeer. \nHe was a wealthy man known for his handsomeness, and a poet living in luxury in \nhis fort south east of Madinah at the rear of Banu Nadeer’s habitations. \nOn hearing the news of Badr, he got terribly exasperated and swore that he would \nprefer death to life if the news was true. When this was confirmed he wrote poems \nsatirizing Muhammad [pbuh], eulogizing Quraish and enticing them against the \nProphet [pbuh]. He then rode to Makkah where he started to trigger the fire of war, \nand kindle rancour against the Muslims in Madinah. When Abu Sufyan asked him \nwhich religion he was more inclined to, the religion of the Makkans or that of \nMuhammad [pbuh] and his companions, he replied that the pagans were better \nguided. With respect to this situation, Allâh revealed His Words: \n\"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They \nbelieve in Jibt and Taghût, and say to the disbelievers that they are better \nguided as regards the way than the believers (Muslims).\" [Al-Qur'an 4:51] \nHe then returned to Madinah to start a fresh campaign of slanderous propaganda \nthat took the form of obscene songs and amatory sonnets with a view to defaming \nthe Muslim women. \n\n152\nAt this stage, the situation became unbearable and could no longer be put up with. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] gathered his men and said: \"Who will kill Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf? He \nhad maligned Allâh, and His Messenger.\" Thereupon, Muhammad bin Maslamah, \n‘Abbad bin Bishr, Al-Harith bin Aws, Abu ‘Abs bin Hibr and Salkan bin Salamah, \nKa‘b’s foster brother, volunteered to do the job. \nMuhammad bin Maslamah said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, do you wish that I should kill \nhim?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit).\" He \nsaid: \"Talk (as you like).\" So, Muhammad bin Maslamah came to Ka‘b and talked to \nhim, saying: \"This man (i.e. the Prophet [pbuh]) has made up his mind to collect \ncharity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship.\" When he heard this, Ka‘b \nsaid: \"By Allâh you will be put to more trouble by him.\" Muhammad bin Maslamah \nanswered: \"No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to \nforsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give \nme a loan.\" He said: \"What will you mortgage?\" Muhammad answered: \"What do you \nwant?\" The immoral and heartless Jew demanded women and children as articles of \nsecurity against the debt. Muhammad said: \"Should we pledge our women whereas \nyou are the most handsome of the Arabs; and the son of one of us may be abused \nby saying that he was pledged for two wasq (measurement unit of weight) of dates \nbut we can pledge you (our) weapons.\" Ka‘b agreed. Salkan bin Salamah, Abu \nNa’ilah, at another time, went to see Ka‘b for the same purpose and there were more \nor less the same subjects, only that Abu Na’ilah would bring him some companions. \nThe plan was successful and provided for the presence of both men and weapons. On \nRabi‘ Al-Awwal 14th, at night, the year 3 A.H. the people said good bye to the \nProphet [pbuh] and set out in the Name of Allâh to implement the carefully drawn \nplan. The Prophet [pbuh] stayed back praying for them and supplicating Allâh to \nrender them success. The men went and called upon him at night. He came down \nalthough his wife warned him not to meet them alleging that: \"I hear a voice which \nsounds like the voice of murder.\" He said: \"It is only Muhammad bin Maslamah and \nmy foster brother Abu Na’ilah. When a gentleman is called at night even if he be \npierced with a spear, he should respond to the call.\" Abu Na’ilah said to his \ncompanions: \"As he comes down, I will extend my hand towards his head to smell \nand when I hold him fast, you should do your job.\" So when he came down, they \ntalked together for about an hour. They then invited him to go out and spend a nice \ntime in the moonlight. On the way out, Abu Na’ilah remarked: \"I smell the nicest \nperfume from you.\" Ka‘b said: \"Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most \nscented of the women of Arabia.\" Abu Na’ilah again said: \"Allow me to smell (the \nscent on your head)\". He said: \"Yes, you may smell.\" So he caught it and smelt. \nThen he said: \"Allow me to do so(once again).\" He then held his head fast and said \nto his companions: \"Do your job.\" And they killed him. The group of men came back \nafter fulfilling their mission. One of them Al-Harith bin Aws was wounded by mistake \nwith the swords of his men, and was bleeding badly. When they reached Baqee‘ Al-\nGharqad, they shouted, \"Allâh is Great\". The Prophet [pbuh] heard them and realized \nthat they had killed the enemy of Allâh.

He said: \n\"By Allâh, I have dreamt of — I implore Allâh to be a dream of bounty — cows \nslaughtered and that there was a groove at the pointed top of my sword, and that I \nhad inserted my hand into an immune armour.\" \nThe interpretation of ‘the cows’ was that some of his men were killed, and ‘the \ngroove at the pointed top of his sword’ was that a member of his House would be \nhurt. As for ‘the armour’ it was Madinah. Then he offered a suggestion that his \nCompanions should not go out of Madinah and that they should encamp themselves \nwithin the city. He was of the opinion that the enemies should be left in the open to \nexhaust themselves and thus the Muslims would not risk a battle. But if they thought \nof attacking Madinah, Muslim men would be ready to fight them at the mouths of \nlanes; whereas Muslim-women would help from over the house roofs.\" ‘Abdullah bin \nUbai bin Salul — the head of the hypocrites; who attended the meeting as a chief of \nAl-Khazraj — supported the Prophet [pbuh]’s plan. \nAs a matter of fact his agreement was not based on the righteousness of the plan \nbut rather on personal benefit. He did not want to fight. On the contrary he secretly \naimed at being far away from fight. However it was Allâh’s Will that he should be \ndisclosed and disgraced in public — for the first time. It was His Will that the curtain \nwhich concealed their disbelief behind should be uncovered and pulled down. Allâh’s \nWill enabled the Muslims to recognize the reality of those snakes that were creeping \nwithin their garments and inside the sleeves of their clothes. Thanks to Allâh they \nrecognized them in one of the most critical times of their lives. \n\n157\nSome of the best honourable Companions, who had missed Al-Jihâd in Badr invasion, \nsuggested that the Prophet [pbuh] should go out of Madinah and urged him to \naccept their point of view. One of them said: \"O, Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], for long \ntime we have been looking forward to this day; and we have implored Allâh to make \nsuch a day draw near.

He selected fifty skillful archers that formed a squad and \nmade them under the command of ‘Abdullah bin Jubair bin An-Nu‘man Al-Ansari Al-\nAwsi Al-Badri. He issued his orders to them to stay where they were — on a \nmountain(side) at the south bank of Qanat Al-Wadi (i.e. a canal of the valley), south \neast of Muslims camp at about one hundred and fifty metres from the Islamic army. \nLater on this mountain was called the Mountain of Archers. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] clarified the mission of this squad in words he \ndirected to them. He said to their leader: \"Drive off the horses from us by means of \narrows, lest they should attack us from behind (the rear). Whether we win the battle \nor lose it, stand steadily in your position and mind that we are not attacked from \nyour side.\"[Ibn Hisham 2/65,66] \nHe added: \n\"Defend our backs! If you see us slain. Do not come to assist us; and if you \nsee gaining grounds, do not share us.\"[Fath Al-Bari 7/350] \nIn a version by Al-Bukhâri the Prophet [pbuh] said: \n\"If you see us snatched into pieces by birds, do not leave this position of \nyours till I send for you. And if you see that we have defeated the enemy \nand trodden on them do not desert your position till I send for you.\"[Sahih \nAl-Bukhari, the Book of Jihad 1/426] \nWith the assignment of this squad and locating it on the mountainside and the \nissuance of those strict military orders, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] blocked the \nonly groove that might lead the idolaters stealthily to the rear of Muslim ranks and \nmight even enable them to encircle them in an encompassment procedure. \nThe assignments of posts and responsibilities for the rest of the army were \nperformed by the Prophet [pbuh] as follows: On the right wing, he appointed Al-\nMundhir bin ‘Amr. On the left he appointed Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam, and made Al-\nMiqdad bin Al-Aswad his assistant and supporter. Az-Zubair’s function was to \nstandfast in the face of Khalid bin Al-Waleed’s horsemen. The Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] selected the top and the most courageous group to be in the vanguard of the \narmy. They were notable for their readiness, alertness and bravery and estimated to \nbe equal to thousands of men. \nIt was a wise and carefully-laid plan which revealed the genius of military leadership \nthat the Prophet [pbuh] possessed. No other leader could have drawn a more \n\n161\naccurate or wise plan. Although he approached the site later than the enemy, he \nmanaged to occupy better positions. He made the rocky mountainside to function as \nshield for the army’s rear and right flank. He was able, by blocking the only \nvulnerable gap on the side, to provide additional maximum protection for the rear as \nwell as the left wing. For fear of possible defeat, and to deter the Muslims from \nfleeing, in which case they would fall easy prisoners in the hands of the enemy, he \nchose a high place for encampment. Moreover a strategic site of this sort would \nsurely inflict heavy losses on the polytheists if they thought of approaching or \noccupying his positions. In a further step, he reduced the enemy to a narrow scope \nof choice when they were cornered for encampment in geographically low positions \nthat would avail them nothing of the benefits of any possible victory; at the same \ntime they would not be able to escape the pursuit of the Muslims in case victory \nsided with the latter.

    "content": "The Combat \nThe two parties approached and grew very close to each another. The phases of fight \nstarted. The first combatant was the standard-bearer, Talha bin Abi Talha Al-‘Abdari, \nwho was the most distinguished idolater. He was one of the bravest men of Quraish \nfighters. Muslims nicknamed him ‘the ram of the battalion.’ He came forth riding a \ncamel and challenged the Muslims to a single combat. People refrained from fighting \nhim due to his bravery; but Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam advanced for the fight. He did \nnot give the ‘Ram’ any chance to fight but fell on him like a lion on his camel’s back, \npulled him down to the ground and slaughtered him with his sword. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who was watching that wonderful incident exclaimed: \nAllâhu Akbar that is ‘Allâh is the Greatest’ and the Muslims exclaimed Allâhu Akbar \ntoo. He praised Az-Zubair when he said: \n\"Every Prophet has a disciple and Az-Zubair is a disciple of mine.\"[As-Seerah Al-\nHalaiyah 2/18] \nSoon the general engagement ensued and the fight of the two parties grew fierce \neverywhere on the battlefield. The strain of the fight was centred round the carriers \nof the standard. After the death of their leader Talha bin Abi Talha, Banu ‘Abd Ad-Dar \nalternated the mission successively. Talha’s brother, ‘Uthman, ran forward and \nseized the standard which lay by the lifeless body of his brother, chanting: \"The \nstandard-bearer has the right to dye its shaft in blood, till it be beaten in his hand.\" \nHamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib attacked and dealt him a blow that cut his arm and \nshoulder and went down to his navel to uncover his lung. \n\n164\nThe standard was raised up again by Abu Sa‘d bin Abi Talha; but Sa‘d bin Abi \nWaqqas shot him with a deadly arrow that hit him at his throat and made his tongue \nhang out breathing his last. \nIn another version it was narrated that Abu Sa‘d lifted the standard up and \nchallenged the Muslims to fight him. ‘Ali bin Abi Talib went forth. They exchanged \ntwo blows. Then ‘Ali gave him a terminal blow that finished him off. \nMusafi‘ bin Talha bin Abi Talha then hoisted the standard, but was soon shot with an \narrow by ‘Asim bin Thabit bin Abi Al-Aqlah. His brother Kilab bin Talha bin Abi Talha \nfollowed him picked the banner and lifted it up; but Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam \nattacked him and managed to kill him. Their brother Al-Jallas bin Talha bin Abi Talha \nlifted the banner up but Talha bin ‘Ubaidu-Allâh stabbed him to death. They also said \nthat it was ‘Asim bin Thabit who managed to deal a terminal blow to him. \nAll those six people killed round and in defence of the standard, belonged to one \nhouse, the house of Abi Talha ‘Abdullah bin ‘Uthman bin ‘Abd Ad-Dar. Another man \nfrom Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar, called Artat bin Sharhabeel carried the standard but he also \nwas killed by ‘Ali bin Abi Talib. Others said it was Hamzah who killed him not ‘Ali. \nThen it was Shuraih bin Qariz who was killed by Quzman — he was a hypocrite who \nfought for prestige only, not in defence of Islam. Abu Zaid ‘Amr bin ‘Abd Munaf Al-\n‘Abdari lifted the standard up but he was killed by Quzman too. A son of Sharhabeel \nbin Hashim Al-‘Abdari hoisted it again and was also killed by Quzman. \nSo we see that ten fighters of Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar — the standard-bearers — were \nannihilated. Seeing that none of ‘Abd Ad-Dars survived to carry the standard, a slave \nof theirs — called Sawab — came to raise it. The slave showed more admirable sorts \nof bravery and steadfastness than his former masters. Sawab, the slave went on \nfighting till his hand was cut off. So he knelt down and embraced the banner, leant it \nagainst his chest and neck lest it should fall down to the ground. He remained \nfighting steadily and steadfastly till he was killed. In the meanwhile he did not stop \nsaying: \"O Allâh, have I been excused?\" Afte",

An idolist woman — called ‘Umra bint ‘Alqama \nAl-Harithiyah — rushed to the lying-on-earth standard, picked it up and hoisted it. \nThe idolaters gathered together around the standard and called out unto one another \ntill they encircled the Muslims and stoodfast to fight again. \nThe Mus",

    "content": "senger of Allâh [pbuh] was then among a small group of fighters — nine in \nnumber at the rear of the army[Sahih Muslim 2/107], watching the engagement and braving \nthe Muslim fighters. Khalid and his men took him by utter surprise, and obliged him \nto follow either of two options: \na. To flee for his life and abandon his army to its doomed end, or \nb. To take action at the risk of his life, rally the ranks of the Muslims again and \nwork their way through the hills of Uhud towards the encompassed army. \n\n168\nThe genius of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], his peerless and matchless courage \nmade him opt for the second course. He raised his voice calling out unto his \nCompanions: \"Slaves of Allâh.\" He did that though he knew that his loud voice would \nbe heard by the idolaters before it was heard by the Muslims. He called out unto \nthem risking his life in this delicate situation. \nThe idolaters, indeed, recognized him and reached his position even before the other \nMuslims could do so. \nThe encompassment of the Muslims revealed three categories of people: The first \ngroup were those who were only interested in themselves and they went so mad that \nthey fled. They left the battlefield and did not know what happened to the others. \nSome of this group fled as far as Madinah. Some others went up the mountain. \nThe second Muslim group were those who returned to the battle, but mixed with the \nidolaters in such a way that they could not recognize one another. Consequently \nsome of them were killed by mistake. On the authority of Al-Bukhari, he states that \n‘Aishah [R] said: \"When it was Uhud Battle, the idolaters were utterly defeated. \nSatan then called out: ‘O slaves of Allâh. Beware the rear (i.e. the enemy is \napproaching from behind)’. So those who were at the front turned back and fought \nthe ones who were behind.\" \nThen Hudhaifah caught sight of his father ‘Al-Yaman’ about to be killed by other \nMuslims. So he said: \"O servants of Allâh! Beware! This is my father. This is my \nfather.\" ‘Aishah [R] said: \"But they did not part with him till he was killed.\" \nHudhaifah then said: \"May Allâh forgive you.\" And ‘Urwa said: \"By Allâh, from that \ntime on Hudhaifah has always been blessed and wealthy till he died.\"[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/539, \n2/581; Fath Al-Bari 7/351, 362, 363] That was because he forgave them and refused to take any \nblood-money for his father’s murder but recommended that it be spent in charity. \nThis Muslim group suffered from great bewilderment, and disorder prevailed among \nthem. A lot of them got lost and did not know where to go. At this awkward time \nthey heard someone calling: \"Muhammad is killed.\" This news made them even more \nbewildered and almost out of sense. Their morale broke down, or almost did in a \ngreat number of individuals. Some of them stopped fighting, slackened, and cast \ndown their weapons. Others thought of getting in touch with ‘Abdullah bin Ubai — \nthe head of the hypocrites — and seeking his assistance to fetch them a security \npledge from Abu Sufyan. \nAnas bin An-Nadr passed by those people who were shuddering of fear and panic, \nand inquired: \"What are you waiting for?\" They said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nhas been killed.\" \"What do you live for after Muhammad [pbuh]? Come on and die \nfor what the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] has died for.\" Then he said: \"O Allâh I \napologize for what these people (i.e. the Muslims) have done; and I swear disavowal \nof what the idolaters have perpetrated.\" Then he moved on till he was encountered \nby Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh who asked him: \"Where to, Abu ‘Umar?\" Anas replied: \"Ah, how \nfine the scent of the Paradise is! I smell it here in Uhud.\" He went on and fought \nagainst the idolaters till he was killed. Nobody but his sister could recognize his dead \nbody. It had been cut and stabbed by over eighty swords, arrows or spears. It was \nby the tip of his finger that she — after the battle — recognized him.[Za'd Al Ma'ad 2/93, 96; \nSahih Al-Bukhari 2/579] \n\n169\nThabit bin Ad-Dahdah called unto his people saying: \n\"O kinfolk of Helpers, if Muhammad [pbuh] were killed, Allâh is Everlasting and He \nnever dies. Fight in defence of your Faith. Allâh will help you and so you will be \nvictorious.\" A group of Helpers joined him and all set out and attacked a battalion of \nKhalid’s horsemen. He kept on fighting till he and his friends were killed.[Ibn Hisham 2/81] \nAn Emigrant passed by a Helper who was besmeared by blood. He said: \"O fellow! \nHave you heard of Muhammad [pbuh]’s murder?\" The Helper answered: \"If \nMuhammad [pbuh] were killed, then he must have completed the delivery of the \nMessage. So fight in defence of your religion!\"[Za'd Al Ma'ad 2/96] \nWith such boldness and encouragement, the Muslims soon recovered their spirits, \ncame round to senses and desisted the idea of surrender or contacting the hypocrite \n‘Abdullah bin Ubai. They took up arms and resumed the fight attempting to make \nway to the headquarters, particularly after the news of the Prophet [pbuh]’s death \nhad been falsified. The glad tidings nerved them, and helped them to manage quite \nsuccessfully the break of the military blockade, and concentrate their forces in an \nimmune place to resume a relentless and fierce fight against the polytheists. \nThe third group of Muslims were those who cared for nothing except the Prophet \n[pbuh]. At the head of them were notable Companions like Abu Bakr, ‘Umar bin Al-\nKhattab, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib and others ÑÖì Çááå Úäåã, who hastened to protect the \nProphet [pbuh] through unrivalled devotion. \nAs those groups of Muslims were receiving the blows of the idolaters and resisting \ninstantly, the fight flared up around the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who had only \nnine people around him. We have already mentioned that when the idolaters started \ntheir encompassment there were only nine persons around the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh]; and that as soon as he called out unto the Muslims: \"Come on! I am the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh],\" the idolaters heard his voice and recognized him. So \nthey turned back and attacked him with all their power before any of his Companions \nran to his aid. \nA violent raging struggle broke out between the nine Muslims and the idolaters \nduring which peerless sort of love, self-sacrifice, bravery and heroism were revealed. \nMuslim, on the authority of Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] along with seven Helpers and two Emigrants, was confined to a trap when the \nidolaters attacked him. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then said: \" He who pushes \nback those idolaters, will be housed in Paradise.\" or \"He will be my Companion in \nParadise.\" One of the Helpers stepped forward and fought the idolaters in defence of \nthe Prophet [pbuh] till he was killed. Then they attacked the Messenger [pbuh] \nagain. The same process was repeated again and again till all the seven Helpers \nwere killed.

    "content": "rd moments of that day, a group of Muslim heroes gathered around \nthe Prophet [pbuh] forming a shield to protect him from the idolaters. Some of them \nwere Abu Dujana, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Sahl bin Haneef, Malik bin — \nSinan the father of Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudri, Umm‘Amara, Nusaiba bint Ka‘b Al-Mâziniya, \nQatada bin An-Nu‘man, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, Hatib bin Abi Balta‘a and Abu Talha. \nThe number of idolaters was steadily increasing; and their attacks, naturally, got \nseverer. Their press had increased to an extent that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nfell into one of the holes dug and designed by Abu ‘Amir Al-Fasiq to be used as traps. \nHis knee scratched and ‘Ali helped him by grasping his hand up. Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh \ntook him in his lap till he could stand upright. Nafi‘ bin Jubair said: I heard an \nEmigrant say: \"I have witnessed Uhud Battle and watched how arrows had been \nhurled from all directions at the Prophet [pbuh]. None of them however hit him. \n‘Abdullah, bin Shihab Az-Zuhri said: ‘Guide me to Muhammad [pbuh]! By Allâh, If I \ndidn’t kill him, I would not hope to live.’ Although the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was \nnext to him, alone — but he did not observe him. Safwan, a co-polytheist of his, \nblamed him (for not translating his words into deeds), but ‘Abdullah swore that he \ndid not see him (the Prophet [pbuh]) and added that he might be immune to our \nattempts on his life. He also said that four of them pledged to make a fresh attempt \nand kill him, but also to no avail. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] \nThe Muslims showed unprecedented rare heroism and marvellous sacrifices. Abu \nTalha — for instance — shielded the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] by his body and used \nhis chest to protect him against the enemy arrows. Anas related that on Uhud Day \nwhen people dispersed off the Prophet [pbuh], Abu Talhah was a skillful sort of \narcher who would pull arrows so much that he broke two or three bows that day. \nWhen a man passed along with a quiver full of arrows, the Prophet [pbuh] would \nsay: \"Spread the arrows to Abu Talhah!\" Then when the Prophet [pbuh] watched \n\n173\npeople shooting, Abu Talhah would say: \"I sacrifice my father and mother for your \nsafety. Do not go too close lest an arrow of theirs should hit you. I would rather die \nthan see you hurt.\"[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/581] \nAbu Dujana stood before the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and used to protect him \nfrom the arrows by his back. Hatib bin Balta‘a followed ‘Utbah bin Abi Waqqas — who \nbroke the honourable incisor (of the Prophet [pbuh]) — struck him with the sword, \ncracked his head and took his mare and sword. Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas was so keen to \nkill his brother ‘Utbah, but he could not; however, Hatib could. \nSahl bin Haneef — a hero archer — who had pledged to die in the cause of Allâh, \nalso played a prominent part in Uhud hostilities. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] himself was involved in shooting arrows. In a version \nby Qatadah bin An-Nu‘man that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] shot so many arrows \nthat the two ends of his bow were flattened. So Qatadah bin An-Nu‘man took it to \nremain with him for good. On that day his eye was so hurt that it fell down onto his \ncheek; but the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] reput it in its socket with his hand and it \nbecame the better and the more sharp-sighted of the two. \nOn that day ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf kept on fighting till his mouth was hurt and got \nbroken. He sustained over twenty wounds, some in his leg, and that lamed him. \nMalik bin Sinan, the father of Abi Sa‘eed Al-Khudri sucked the blood out of the \nProphet [pbuh]’s cheek till he cleaned it. The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Spit it!\". But \nMalik said: \"By Allâh, I will never spit it\". Then he set out to fight. The Prophet \n[pbuh] then said: \"He who wants to see a man of the people of Paradise, let him look \nat this one.\" No sooner had he resumed fighting than he was martyred in the thick of \nthe battle. \nUmm ‘Amarah participated in the fight too. She encountered Ibn Qami’a in combat, \nand sustained a slight wound on her shoulder, but she herself also struck him with \nher sword several times but he survived because he was wearing two armours. She, \nhowever, went on striking until her wounds counted twelve. \nMus‘ab bin ‘Umair, in his turn, fought fiercely and violently defending the Prophet \n[pbuh] against the attacks of Ibn Qami’a and his fellows. He was carrying the \nstandard with his right hand. In the process of fighting, it was cut off, so he grabbed \nthe standard in his left hand till this was also amputated so he knelt down and \nshielded it with his chest and neck. Ibn Qami’a then killed him, mistaking him for the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] on account of resemblance in appearance. Only then did \nIbn Qami’a shout ‘Muhammad [pbuh] has been killed.’[Ibn Hisham 2/73; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] \nNo sooner had Ibn Qami’a uttered that ominous sentence than consternation spread \namong Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers, and their morale was drastically reduced. \nConsequently, confusion and a miserable state of disorder prevailed amongst them. \nWhilst the rumours managed to adversely act amongst the Muslims, it alleviated the \nsharp impact of the assaults of the polytheists who came to believe that they did \nreally achieve their final objective and so they turned towards mutilating the dead \nbodies. \n\n174\nWhen Mus‘ab was killed, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] delivered the standard to ‘Ali \nbin Abi Talib. ‘Ali, in conjunction with the other Companions, went on fighting bravely \nand set marvellous examples of heroism, courage and endurance in both defence \nand attack. \nThen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] made his way to his encircled army. Ka‘b bin \nMalik, who was the first one to recognize the approaching Prophet [pbuh], shouted \nas loudly as he could: \"O folks of Muslims, be cherished! The Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] is here.\" But the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] signed to him to stop lest his \nposition should be located by the idolaters. Upon hearing the shout, the Muslims \nimmediately raced towards the source of the shout which brought about thirty \nCompanions to gather around the Prophet [pbuh]. With this assembled number of his \nCompanions, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started drawing a planned withdrawal to \nthe hillocks nearby. \nHostilities of the enemy grew fiercer than ever with the aim of foiling the plan of \nwithdrawal of the Muslims. Their attempts however proved to be fruitless due to the \nheroic steadfastness of the lions of Islam. \n‘Uthman bin ‘Abdullah bin Al-Mugheerah — one of the enemy horsemen — \nprogressed towards the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] while saying: \"Either I kill him \n(i.e. Muhammad [pbuh]) or I will be killed.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] moved to \nencounter him but his mare tripped into some holes. So Al-Harith bin As-Simma \ncombated with the enemy, and struck him on his leg so he went lame, then he \nfinished him off, took his arm and overtook the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. \nBut later on another Makkan horseman, called ‘Abdullah bin Jabir, attacked Al-Harith \nbin As-Simma, and struck him on the shoulder with his sword and he was carried to \nthe camp of the Muslims suffering from serious wounds. Anyway that very idolater \ndid not escape death, for Abu Dujana — the red head-banded hero and adventurer — \nstruck him heavily and cut his head off. \nDuring this bitter fight, a desire to sleep overwhelmed the Muslims — that was a \nsecurity and tranquillity to help His slave Muslims as the Qur’ân spoke in this \ncontext. Abu Talhah said: \"I was one of those who were possessed by a desire to \nsleep on Uhud Day. On that day my sword fell off my hand several times. Again and \nagain it fell down and again and again I picked it up.\"[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/582] \nIn a regular withdrawal and with great bravery and boldness, the Muslims finally \nretreated to the cover of Mountain Uhud.

Either I kill him or I will be killed.’ The Companions of Muhammad [pbuh] \nsaid: ‘O Messenger of Allâh, do you mind if one of us combats with him?’ But the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: ‘Leave him!’ So when he drew nearer, the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] took the spear from Al-Harith bin As-Simma. He shivered \nviolently in such a way that made all of them scatter in all directions violently and \nimpulsively. Then he faced him, observed his clavicle through a gap between the \nwide opening of the armour and the part of his neck enclosed by. He speared him in \n\n175\nthat spot. The effect of the stroke was so strong that it made him roll off his horse \nover and over. When he returned to Quraish, they found that he had only had a \nsmall scratch in his neck. So when blood became congested he said: ‘By Allâh, \nMuhammad has killed me.’ Hearing him say so, they said: ‘By Allâh you are afraid to \ndeath. By Allâh, you are possessed by a devil.’ He replied: ‘He had already told me \nwhen we were in Makkah: ‘I will kill you.’ By Allâh, had he spate on me, he would \nhave killed me.’ Eventually, the enemy of Allâh breathed his last at a place called \nSarif, while they were taking him back to Makkah.\"[Ibn Hisham 2/84; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] In a \nversion by Abul-Aswad, on the authority of ‘Urwa: He was lowing like a bull and \nsaying: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if (the pain) I am suffering from now \nwere distributed among the people of Al-Majaz, it would cause them to die.\"[Mukhtasar \nSeerat Ar-Rasool p.250] \nDuring the withdrawal of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] up to the cover of the \nmountain, a big rock blocked his way. The Prophet [pbuh] tried to mount it, but \nhaving worn a short heavy armour, and being seriously wounded — he could not \nascend it. Readily enough Talha sat in a position that enabled the Prophet [pbuh] to \nstand on his back. Then he lifted him up till he stood on it. The Prophet [pbuh] then \nsaid: \"Talha, after this job, is eligible for the Garden (Paradise).\"[Ibn Hisham 2/86] \nWhen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] settled down in his head quarters in the hillock, \nthe idolaters started their last attack upon the Muslims.

So \nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] implored his Lord saying: ‘O Allâh, they (i.e. the \nidolaters) should not be higher (i.e. in position or in power) than us (i.e. the \nMuslims).

Sa‘d then took an arrow out of his \nquiver, shot it at one of them and killed him. He said: \"Then I took another one I \nknow (to be good) and I shot with it another man.

Being \nalmost certain of his death, the idolaters returned to their camp and started \npreparations to go back to Makkah.

They even cut open their bellies. Hind bin ‘Utbah \n— for instance — ripped open the liver of Hamzah and chewed it; but finding it \nunpleasant, she spat it out. She even made the ears and noses of Muslims into \nanklets and necklaces. [Ibn Hisham 2/90] \nTwo incidents occurred during the last hours of the fight.

Then I saw an armed stout idolater \npass through the Muslims and say: \"Gather them up and combine them in the \nway that sheep are gathered and slaughtered.\" Similarly I saw an armed \nMuslim waiting for him. I walked towards them till I stood behind him. \nComparing both of them, I found that the disbeliever was better than the \nother in arms and figure.

Zaid bin Thabit said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sent \nme on Uhud Day to seek Sa‘d bin Ar-Rabî‘ and said: \"When you see him, say: ‘peace \nbe upon you from me.’ and say to him ‘the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] says: How do \nyou feel?’\" Zaid said: \"I started wandering about checking the killed till I came across \nSa‘d when he was dying — with about seventy strokes or stabs of a sword, a spear \nand an arrow in his body.So I said: \"O Sa‘d, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sends \nyou his greetings. and says ‘peace be upon you, tell me how do you feel?’\" Sa‘d said: \n\n178\n\"And let peace be upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], too. Tell him, I smell the \nscent of the Paradise. And tell the Helpers, my people, ‘you shall not be excused \nbefore Allâh if the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] is hurt and your eyes are blinking’ (i.e. \nyou are still alive and not dead).\" Then he died. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/96] \nThey came across Al-Usairim — ‘Amr bin Thabit, whom they had already urged to \nembrace Islam but refused. They saw him among the wounded on the verge of close \ndeath. \"What has he come here for? We have parted with him and he was still too \nobdurate to accept Islam as his religion\". They asked him: \"What made you come \nhere? Is it out of zeal to defend your people or is it because of an inclination to \nIslam?\" He said: \"It is (certainly) an inclination to Islam. I believe in Allâh and in His \nMessenger. I have fought with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] till I have got what you \nsee,\" and then he immediately died. They told the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] about \nhim. Hearing that, he said: \"He is one",

    "content": "l, and after their return from Uhud, the \nMuslims spent that night in an emergency case — though they were dead-beat, \nextremely exhausted. They stayed on the alert, and spent that night guarding the \noutlets and inlets of Madinah. They were specially busy guarding their general \nleader, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] for fear that some suspects could commit an \nunexpected folly. \nHamrâ’ Al-Asad Invasion \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on his part, spent the night pondering over the \nsituation. He feared that the idolaters might think — while they were still on their \nway to Makkah — of reversing their way and diverting to Madinah after they had \nrealized that they had availed nothing of that victory. They might regret and decide \nto invade Madinah as a compensation. Therefore the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was \ndetermined to go out in pursuit of the Makkan army. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] called out unto people and ordered them to march to encounter \nthe enemy of Islam. That was on Sunday morning — next day to Uhud — the eighth \nof Shawwal. He said: \"Nobody will march to the fight except those who have already \nparticipated in Uhud fight.\" ‘Abdullah bin Ubai said: \"I will march out with you.\" \"No,\" \nsaid the Prophet [pbuh]. \nWhilst the Muslims were suffering a lot from painful pains and deep anxiety, they \nresponded to his call positively. Jabir bin ‘Abdullah implored the Prophet [pbuh] to \nallow him join them in that fresh invasion on account that he always had a liking to \nwitness all the battles that the Prophet [pbuh] was involved in. He had not \nparticipated in Uhud because his father asked him to stay in Madinah with his sisters \n. And he was granted his wish. \nThe Muslims marched out until they reached a place called Hamra’ Al-Asad — about \neight miles from Madinah. He encamped there. In that place Ma‘bad bin Abi Ma‘bad \ncame to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and professed Islam. Some people said that \nhe remained an idolater; he simply desired to give the Messenger some advice out of \nabidance by a covenant between Khuza‘ah (his tribe) and Bani Hashim. He said \"O \nMuhammad [pbuh]! By Allâh, we feel great sorrow for what had happened to you \nand to your Companions. We really hope you will not suffer again.\" So, the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] suggested that he overtake Abu Sufyan and discourage \nhim from pursuing his evil intentions. \nThe Messenger’s fears of a possible return of the idolaters proved to be absolutely \ntrue. For no sooner had the idolaters dismounted and encamped at Ar-Rawhâ’ — a \n\n182\nplace thirty-six miles from Madinah, than they started reproaching one another. A \ngroup of them said to another one: \"You did nothing. You broke down their force but \nyou left them. There are still some distinguished men among them who will probably \ngather people up to fight you again. So let us go back and annihilate them and crush \ndown their forces.\" \nIt was in fact a hasty decision taken by shallow-minded people who misjudged the \npotential power and morale on both parties, that is why an eminent leader of \nQuraish, Safwan bin Omaiyah, tried to dissuade his people from pursuing that \nventure, saying: \"O people. Do not do such a thing! For I fear that he will gather up \nthose who had stayed behind and did not share in Uhud. Go back home as winners. \nFor I am not sure of what turn will the consequences take if you get involved in such \na fight. It might be to your prejudice in the final place.\" Notwithstanding that \nweighty argument, the majority of the polytheists were determined to embark on \nthat risky undertaking. \nMa‘bad bin Abu Ma‘bad meanwhile arrived on the scene and tried to exaggerate the \ndanger awaiting them in order to thwart their plan, he said: \"Muhammad [pbuh] has \nmarched to meet you with a large host of fighters, I have never seen something \nsimilar to it before. He has mustered all the troops who have tarried and did not \nshare in Uhud. They surely regret what they have missed and want to compensate \nfor it now. Their hearts are filled with hate and resentment.\" Abu Sufyan said: \"Woe \nto you! What do you suggest?\" He said: \"By Allâh, I see that you would not leave till \nhe comes and you see the heads of their horses; or till the vanguard of his army \nturns up to you from behind that hill.\" \nAbu Sufyan said: \"By Allâh, we have reached a common consent to crush down the \nMuslims and their power.\" The man, once more with an implied warning, advised him \nto stop it. \nIn the light of this news, the resolution and determination of the Makkan army failed \nand panic and terror took firm hold of them. They consequently deemed it safest to \ncomplete there withdrawal back to Makkah. They, however, as an alternative, \nstarted a hostile nerve propaganda aiming at dissuading the Muslims army from \npursuing them. A caravan belonging to ‘Abd Qais happened to pass by towards \nMadinah. Abu Sufyan, in the context of his propaganda, asked them to communicate \na message to Muhammad [pbuh] to the effect that the Makkans had rallied their \nranks to annihilate the Messenger and his Companions, in return Abu Sufyan \npromised to give the people of the caravan loads of raisins at the forum of ‘Ukaz the \nfollowing year. \nThe people of the caravan conveyed the message to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nat Hamrâ’ Al-Asad, but to no effect, on the contrary, Abu Sufyan’s words augmented \nthem in Faith. Allâh says: \n\"… And they said: ‘Allâh (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best \nDisposer of affairs (for us). So they turned with Grace and Bounty from \nAllâh. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allâh. \nAnd Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.\" [Al-Qur'an 3:173,174] \nAfter the arrival of the caravan on Sunday, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] stayed at \nHamrâ’ Al-Asad for three days — Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday — 9-11 \n\n183\nShawwal, 3 A.H. and then returned to Madinah. Before his return, he took Abu ‘Azza \nAl-Jumahi as a prisoner of war. Incidentally, this man had also been captured at Badr \nbut on account of his poverty, and the large family he supported, the Prophet [pbuh] \nhad been gracious enough to release him on condition that he would not involve \nhimself in war against the Muslims again. Abu ‘Azza did not keep his promise and \ntook part in Uhud hostilities on the side of the polytheists. Here again he implored \nMuhammad [pbuh] for pardon but the latter told him that a believer wouldn’t be \ntaken twice in the same snare. He then deservedly merited the sentence of death \nwhich was executed by Az-Zubair or, in another version, by ‘Asim bin Thabit. \nA Makkan spy, called Mu‘awiyah bin Al-Mugheerah bin Abi Al-‘As, was sentenced to \ndeath too. This spy was the grandfather of ‘Abdul Malik bin Marwan on his mother \nside. When the idolaters went back after Uhud, Mu‘awiyah came to his paternal \ncousin ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan ÑÖì Çááå Úäå. ‘Uthman gave him shelter — after securing \nthe Prophet [pbuh]’s permission — on condition that if he was caught there after \nthree days, he would be killed. But he did not comply with it, so when the Muslim \narmy left Madinah, he stayed there for more than three days during which he was \nspying for Quraish. So when the army returned, Mu‘awiyah fled out of Madinah. The \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], on this account, ordered Zaid bin Harithah and ‘Ammar \nbin Yasir to pursue him and kill him. So he was killed. [Ibn Hisham 2/60-129; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/91-108; \nFath Al-Bari 7/345-377; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.242-275] \nUndoubtedly, the invasion of Hamrâ’ Al-Asad is not a separate invasion, but rather a \npart, or more specifically, a sequel to Uhud. \nThat was Uhud Invasion with all its stages and details. It has for long been discussed \nby scholars and men of research. Was it a defeat or not? Doubtlessly, the military \nsuperiority in the second phase of the battle was in favour of the polytheists who \ncould successfully direct the steering mechanism of hostilities and inflict heavy losses \nin lives on the Muslims. Admittedly, a part of the believers were clearly defeated, but \nthis could never be considered a Makkan victory. \nThe Makkan army failed to occupy the camp of the Muslims. The greater bulk of the \nMadinese army, chaos and confusion notwithstanding, did not take to escape, on the \ncontrary they showed matchless and heroic resistance and managed to gather \nthemselves again around their headquarters fighting bravely and courageously. \nThey, moreover, did not allow the Makkans to run after them in pursuit. Neither \nMuslim captives were taken nor spoils were gained by the Makkans. The enemies of \nIslam were also too cowardly to conduct the third phase of war, and impress their \nsuperiority on the battlefield, on the contrary, they were in hot haste to evacuate the \nfield even before the Muslims did. Madinah itself, the capital of the Muslims, was only \na stone’s throw from the lines of the enemy, and vulnerably exposed, yet the \npolytheists were not bold enough to storm it to plunder its wealth or capture the \nMuslim women therein. \nThese suggestive details in fact support our argument that the event of Uhud was \njust a precious occasion on which the Makkans managed only to inflict heavy losses \non the Muslims but failed to achieve their ultimate goals of annihilating the Muslim \narmy in the process of their encompassment operation. After all, it is not unusual for \nconquerors to sustain such casualties and losses, but these could under no \ncircumstances be regarded as victory for the hostile party. \n\n184\nThe incident of Hamrâ’ Al-Asad is interesting in this regard. It is a curious sight \nindeed of a victorious army in retreat for fear of disgrace and defeat, and the \ncrestfallen and crippled group of Muslims in pursuit. \nUhud Battle in the final judgement was just one phase of military activities in the \nwhole process of war between two hostile parties each of whom earned their \nlegitimate portion of both success and failure and then desisted further engagement \nbut without cowardly escape or resigned surrender. In this sense, this battle could be \nrightly regarded as an inseparable war. \nIn this context, Allâh says: \n\"And don’t be weak in the pursuit of the enemy; if you are suffering \n(hardships) then surely, they (too) are suffering (hardships) as you are \nsuffering, but you have a hope from Allâh (for the reward, i.e. Paradise) that \nfor which they hope not.\" [Al-Qur'an 4:104] \nThe verse explicitly identifies both attitudes as regards losses and hardships as \nidentical.

    "enhanced_text": "l, and after their return from Uhud, the \nMuslims spent that night in an emergency case — though they were dead-beat, \nextremely exhausted. They stayed on the alert, and spent that night guarding the \noutlets and inlets of Madinah. They were specially busy guarding their general \nleader, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] for fear that some suspects could commit an \nunexpected folly. \nHamrâ’ Al-Asad Invasion \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on his part, spent the night pondering over the \nsituation. He feared that the idolaters might think — while they were still on their \nway to Makkah — of reversing their way and diverting to Madinah after they had \nrealized that they had availed nothing of that victory. They might regret and decide \nto invade Madinah as a compensation. Therefore the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was \ndetermined to go out in pursuit of the Makkan army. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] called out unto people and ordered them to march to encounter \nthe enemy of Islam. That was on Sunday morning — next day to Uhud — the eighth \nof Shawwal. He said: \"Nobody will march to the fight except those who have already \nparticipated in Uhud fight.\" ‘Abdullah bin Ubai said: \"I will march out with you.\" \"No,\" \nsaid the Prophet [pbuh]. \nWhilst the Muslims were suffering a lot from painful pains and deep anxiety, they \nresponded to his call positively. Jabir bin ‘Abdullah implored the Prophet [pbuh] to \nallow him join them in that fresh invasion on account that he always had a liking to \nwitness all the battles that the Prophet [pbuh] was involved in. He had not \nparticipated in Uhud because his father asked him to stay in Madinah with his sisters \n. And he was granted his wish. \nThe Muslims marched out until they reached a place called Hamra’ Al-Asad — about \neight miles from Madinah. He encamped there. In that place Ma‘bad bin Abi Ma‘bad \ncame to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and professed Islam. Some people said that \nhe remained an idolater; he simply desired to give the Messenger some advice out of \nabidance by a covenant between Khuza‘ah (his tribe) and Bani Hashim. He said \"O \nMuhammad [pbuh]! By Allâh, we feel great sorrow for what had happened to you \nand to your Companions. We really hope you will not suffer again.\" So, the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] suggested that he overtake Abu Sufyan and discourage \nhim from pursuing his evil intentions. \nThe Messenger’s fears of a possible return of the idolaters proved to be absolutely \ntrue. For no sooner had the idolaters dismounted and encamped at Ar-Rawhâ’ — a \n\n182\nplace thirty-six miles from Madinah, than they started reproaching one another. A \ngroup of them said to another one: \"You did nothing. You broke down their force but \nyou left them. There are still some distinguished men among them who will probably \ngather people up to fight you again. So let us go back and annihilate them and crush \ndown their forces.\" \nIt was in fact a hasty decision taken by shallow-minded people who misjudged the \npotential power and morale on both parties, that is why an eminent leader of \nQuraish, Safwan bin Omaiyah, tried to dissuade his people from pursuing that \nventure, saying: \"O people.

He \nsent six of his Companions, in another version, ten headed by Murthid bin Abi \nMurthid Al-Ghanawi, or, according to Al-Bukhari, ‘Asim bin Thabit, the grandfather of \n‘Asim bin ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. When they reached a spot called Ar-Raji‘ between \nRabigh and Jeddah, a hundred archers of Banu Lihyan clan surrounded the place and \nattacked them. The delegation of Muslims took shelter on some high ground, Fudfud, \nand the bedouins offered them a pledge that they would not be killed. ‘Asim refused \nto come down, instead he fought them until he and six of his companions were \nkilled. Three men were left, Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathna and another one. Once \nagain, the bedouins offered them a guarantee of safety and they accepted. When \nthey descended, the bedouins treacherously bound them. The third man rebuked \nthem for their insincerity and resisted them so they killed him. The other two men \nwho had killed some notables of Quraish at Badr were taken and sold in Makkah. The \nfirst was Khubaib who was detained for some time and then it was unanimously \ndecided to crucify him. He was taken from the Holy Sanctuary to At-Tan‘im for \ncrucifixion. He requested a respite to offer a two-Rak‘a prayer. After the final \ngreeting, he turned to his executioners, and said: \"Had I not been afraid that you \nwould think that I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a long time.\" It was \nthen that Khubaib first set the tradition of praying two Rak‘a before being executed. \nHe then said: \n\"O Lord! Count them one by one, exterminate them to the last one.\" \nHe then recited some verses of poetry which speak eloquently of the atrocities borne \nby him, and testify to his Faith in Allâh at this hour of suffering: \nThe confederates have gathered their tribes around me, \nAnd summoned all of them who could come. \nThey have gathered their women and children, \nI am bound fastly to a lofty trunk. \nTo Allâh alone I complain of my helplessness and sufferings, \nAnd of the death, the confederates have prepared for me. \nLord of the Throne! Give me endurance against their design, \nThey have cut my flesh bit by bit, and I have been deprived of sustenance. \nThey let me choose infidelity but death is preferable, \nTears roll out of my eyes, though not of fear. \nBy Allâh! I fear not if I die a Muslim, \nOn what side I fall for the sake of Allâh. \nI will not show subservience to the enemy, \nIf Lord so desires, He will bless my torn limbs and broken joints. \nAbu Sufyan then addressed him saying: \"I adjure you by Allâh, don’t you wish that \nMuhammad [pbuh] were here in your place so that we might cut off his head, and \n\n188\nthat you were with your family?\" Khubaib answered, \"By Allâh, I do not wish that \nMuhammad [pbuh] now were in the place I occupy or that a thorn could hurt him, \nand that I were sitting with my family.\" Quraish ordered ‘Uqbah bin Al-Harith, whose \nfather had been killed by Khubaib himself, to crucify him.

    "content": "of Ma‘una Well \nMa‘una Well tragedy, which was even more horrible than that of Ar-Raji‘, took place \nin the same month. \nAbu Bara’ — ‘Amir bin Malik — nicknamed ‘Spear Player’ came to the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] in Madinah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] called him to embrace Islam \nbut he neither agreed nor refused. He said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, if you dispatch \nsome of your Companions to the people of Najd to call them to Islam, I expect them \nto accept.\" \"I am afraid the people of Najd will kill them.\" Said the Messenger. But he \nreplied, \"I will protect them.\" Ibn Ishaq confirms that forty men were sent to them; \nbut As-Sahih states that they were seventy — Al-Mundhir bin ‘Amr, one of Bani \nSa‘ida, nicknamed ‘Freed to die’ — commanded that group, who were the best and \nmost learned in the Qur’ân and jurisprudence. \nOn their way to Najd they used to gather firewood to buy food for the people of ‘Ahl \nAs-Suffah’ as charity by day and study, meditate on the meanings of the Qur’ân by \nnight. They kept on doing that till they arrived at Ma‘una Well — which was a well in \nbetween Bani ‘Amir, Harrah and Bani Saleem. They stayed there and sent the \nMessage of the Prophet [pbuh] with Haram bin Milhan, the brother of Umm Sulaim to \nthe enemy of Allâh ‘Amir bin At-Tufail. ‘Amir did not heed the Message but rather \nordered a man to spear Haram in the back. When the spear penetrated Haram’s \nbody, he saw the blood and said: \"Allâhu Akbar! (i.e. Allâh is the Greatest) By Lord \nof Al-Ka‘bah I have won!\" \nThen the enemy of Allâh, promptly, called out Bani ‘Amir to fight the rest. Bani ‘Amir \nrefused because they were under the protection of Abu Bara’. Therefore he turned to \nBani Saleem for help. The people of ‘Usaiyah, Ri‘al and Dhakwan, who were folks of \nBani Saleem, responded to his call. The Companions of the Prophet [pbuh], who \nwere encompassed by idolaters, kept on fighting till they were all killed. The only \n\n189\nsurvivor was Ka‘b bin Zaid bin An-Najjar who was carried wounded from among the \ndead. It was in Al-Khandaq (the trench) Battle that he was killed. \n‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari and Al-Mundhir bin ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir, who were \nentrusted with the Muslims’ animals far from them, saw the birds circling in the air \nover the battleground. Al-Mundhir rushed to share in the fight till he was killed. But \n‘Amr bin Omaiyah was captured. ‘Amir set him free when he knew that he was of \nMudar tribe but that was after he had cut his hair. He did that to fulfil a pledge of his \nmother’s to set a slave free. \nReturning to the Prophet [pbuh] ‘Amr bin Omaiyah conveyed the news of the painful \ndisaster, which resulted in the murder of seventy of the best believers, and recalled \nthe tragedy of Uhud but with the difference that those of Uhud were killed in a clear \nwar but those of Ma‘una were killed in a disgraceful treachery. On his way back to \nQarqara, ‘Amr bin Omaiyah rested in the shade of a tree, and there two men of Bani \nKilab joined him. When they slept, ‘Amr killed them both, thinking that by doing that \nhe would avenge some of his killed companions. Then he found out that they had \nbeen given a pledge of protection by the Prophet [pbuh]. He told the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] what he had done. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to ‘Amr: \"You \nhave killed two people; their blood-money shall be a debt I have to discharge.\" He \nthen engaged himself collecting their blood-money from the Muslims and their allies, \nthe Jews [Ibn Hisham 2/183-188; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/109-110; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/584-\n586]. This very act was later to trigger the invasion of Bani An-Nadeer. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] was so deeply moved by this tragedy and that of Ar-Raji‘ that he \nused to invoke Allâh’s wrath against those people and tribes who killed his \nCompanions. Anas reported that for thirty days the Prophet [pbuh] supplicated Allâh \nagainst those who killed his Companions at Ma‘una Well. Every dawn prayer he \nwould invoke Allâh’s wrath against Ri‘l, Dhakwan, Lihyan and ‘Usaiyah.

    "content": "the Prophet [pbuh] delegated Muhammad bin Maslamah to communicate \nan ultimatum to Bani Nadeer to the effect that they should evacuate Madinah within \nten days, otherwise, their heads would be cut off. The chief of the hypocrites, \n‘Abdullah bin Ubai, urged the Jews not to pay heed to the Prophet [pbuh]’s words \nand to stay in their habitations, offering to run to their support with two thousands of \nhis followers, and assuring them of help to come from Quraizah tribe and former \nallies Banu Ghatfan. In this regards, Allâh says: \n\"If you are expelled, we (too) indeed will go out with you, and we shall \nnever obey anyone against you, and if you are attacked (in fight), we shall \nindeed help you.\" [Al-Qur'an 59:11] \nThe Jews regained their confidence and were determined to fight. Their chief Huyai \nbin Akhtab relied hopefully on what the chief of the hypocrites said. So he sent to the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] saying: \"We will not leave our houses. Do whatever you \nlike to do.\" \nUndoubtedly the situation was awkward for the Muslims. Launching a war against \ntheir opponents at this critical stage could entail terrible far reaching ramifications in \nthe light of the unfavourable conditions they were passing through, besides the \nhostile environment growing in power and hatred around them, the harbinger of \nwhich assumed the form of killing the Muslim missions, as it has been already \nintroduced. \nThe Jews of Bani Nadeer were also a power to count for, and the prospects of \ninflicting a military defeat on them was precarious; consequently forcing them into \nwar engagement would be attended with unpredictable risks. On the other hand, the \ncontinual state of repeated assassinations and acts of treachery carried out against \nthe Muslims individually and collectively brought about unbearable headache to \nMuhammad [pbuh]’s followers. Having judged all the prevalent status quo in this \nperspective, and in the light of the disgraceful attempt on the life of the Prophet \n[pbuh], the Muslims made the decisive decisions of taking up arms whatever turn \nthe consequences could assume. \n\n191\nWhen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] received the reply of Huyai bin Akhtab he said: \n\"Allâhu Akbar, Allâhu Akbar.\" (Allâh is the Greatest of all) and his Companions \nrepeated after him. Then he set out to fight them after appointing Ibn Umm Maktum \nto dispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. The standard was entrusted to \n‘Ali bin Abi Talib. He laid siege to their forts for six nights — in another version, \nfifteen. \nBanu Nadeer resorted to their castles, mounted them and started shooting arrows \nand pelting stones at the Muslims enjoying the strategic advantage that their thick \nfields of palm trees provided. The Muslims were therefore ordered to fell and burn \nthose trees. In this respect, Allâh, the All-Mighty, states in the Qur’ân: \n\"What you (O Muslims) cut down of the palm-trees (of the enemy), or you \nleft them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allâh.\" [Al-Qur'an 59:5] \nQuraizah tribe remained neutral, and the hypocrite ‘Abdullah bin Ubai as well as \nGhatfan failed to keep their promises of support.

The Prophet [pbuh] accepted their request and allowed them to carry as \nmuch luggage as their camels could lift, arms were excepted. Of course, they had no \nchoice but to carry out the orders, so they took with them everything they could \ncarry even the pegs and beams of ceilings. Their caravan counted 600 loaded camels \nincluding their chiefs, Huyai bin Akhtab and Salam bin Abi Al-Huqaiq, who left for \nKhaibar whereas another party shifted to Syria.

The rules relating to the prayer of fear which the Prophet [pbuh] observed \nat Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign, were revealed at ‘Asfan Invasion and this beyond a \nshadow of doubt",

    "content": "Al-Ahzab (the Confederates) Invasion \nOnce again, peace and security enveloped the Arabian Peninsula and this turbulent \narea began to experience a period of lull after a whole year war. The Jews, however, \nwhose treachery, intrigues and disloyalty made them taste all types of humiliation \nand disgrace, were not admonished. After they had been exiled to Khaibar, they \nremained waiting anxiously for the results of the skirmishes going on between the \nMuslims and the idolaters. Contrary to their hopes, the events of the war were in \nfavour of the Muslims, therefore they started a new stage of conspiracy and prepared \nthemselves to deal a deadly blow against the Muslims, but were too cowardly to \nmanoeuvre directly against them, so they laid a dreadful plan in order to achieve \ntheir objectives. Twenty chiefs of the Jews with some celebrities of Bani Nadir went \nto Makkah to negotiate an unholy alliance with Quraish. They began to goad the \npeople there to attack the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] promising them full support \nand backing. People of Quraish, who had been languid and proved too weak to \nchallenge the Muslims at Badr, seized this opportunity to redeem their stained \nhonour and blemished reputation. The same delegation set out for Ghatfan, called \nthem to do the same, and they responded positively. The Jewish delegation then \nstarted a fresh effort and toured some parts of Arabia and managed to incite the \nconfederates of disbelief against the Prophet [pbuh], his Message and the believers \nin Allâh. Quraish, Kinanah and other allies from Tihama, in the south; rallied, ranked \nand recruited four thousand men under the leadership of Abu Sufyan. From the east \nthere came tribes of Banu Saleem, Ghatfan, Bani Murrah, etc. They all headed for \nMadinah and gathered in its vicinity at a time already agreed upon. It was a great \narmy of ten thousand fighters. They in fact outnumbered all the Muslims in Madinah, \nwomen, lads and elders included. To tell the truth, if they had launched a surprise \nattack against Madinah, they could have exterminated all the Muslims. However, the \nleadership inside the city was on the alert and the intelligence personnel managed to \nreconnoitre the area of the enemies, and reported their movement to the people in \ncharge in Madinah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned a high advisory board \nand conducted a careful discussion of a plan to defend Madinah. After a lengthy talk \nbetween military leaders and people possessed of sound advice, it was agreed, on \nthe proposal of an honourable Companion, Salman Al-Farisi, to dig trenches as \ndefensive lines. The Muslims, with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head, encouraging, \nhelping and reminding them of the reward in the Hereafter, most actively and \ndiligently started to build a trench around Madinah. Severe hunger, bordering on \nstarvation, could not dissuade or discourage them from achieving their desperately \nsought objective. Salman said: O Messenger of Allâh! When siege was to laid to us in \nPersia, we used to dig trenches to defend ourselves. It was really an unprecedented \nwise plan. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] hurriedly gave orders to implement the \nplan. Forty yards was allocated to each group of ten to dig. Sahl bin Sa‘d said: We \nwere in the company of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], the men used to dig and we \nevacuate the earth on our backs. \nSome preternatural Prophetic signs appeared in the process of trenching. Jabir bin \n‘Abdullah, seeing the Prophet [pbuh] starving, slaughtered a sheep, cooked some \nbarley and requested the Prophet [pbuh] and some Companions to accept his \ninvitation, but the Prophet [pbuh] gathered all the thousand people engaged in \ndigging the trench and they started to eat until they were all completely full and yet \nthe shoulder of mutton and dough that was being baked remained as they were \nundiminished. A certain woman brought a handful of dates and passed by the \nProphet [pbuh], who took the dates, threw them over his cloak and invited his \n\n196\nfollowers to eat. The dates began to increase in number until they dropped over the \ntrim of his robe. Another illustrious preternatural example went to the effect that an \nobstinate rock stood out as an immune obstacle in the ditch. The Prophet [pbuh] \ntook the spade and struck, and the rock immediately turned into a loose sand dune. \nIn another version, Al-Bara‘ said: On Al-Khandaq (the trench) Day there stood out a \nrock too immune for our spades to break up. We therefore went to see the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] for advice. He took the spade, and struck the rock \nuttering \"in the Name of Allâh, Allâh is Great, the keys of Ash-Shâm (Geographical \nSyria) are mine, I swear by Allâh, I can see its palaces at the moment;\" on the \nsecond strike he said: \"Allâh is Great, Persia is mine, I swear by Allâh, I can now see \nthe white palace of Madain;\" and for the third time he struck the rock, which turned \ninto very small pieces, he said: \"Allâh is Great, I have been given the keys of Yemen, \nI swear by Allâh, I can see the gates of San‘a while I am in my place.\" The same \nversion was narrated by Ishaq.[Ibn Hisham 3/330,331] The northern part of Madinah was the \nmost vulnerable, all the other sides being surrounded by mountains and palm tree \norchards, the Prophet [pbuh] as a skillful military expert, understood that the \nConfederates would march in that direction, so the trench was ordered to be on that \nside. The Muslims went on digging the trench for several days; they used to work on \nit during the day, and go back home in the evening until it had assumed its full \ndimensions militarily before the huge army of the idolaters;[ibid] which numbered, a",
    "enhanced_text": "Al-Ahzab (the Confederates) Invasion \nOnce again, peace and security enveloped the Arabian Peninsula and this turbulent \narea began to experience a period of lull after a whole year war. The Jews, however, \nwhose treachery, intrigues and disloyalty made them taste all types of humiliation \nand disgrace, were not admonished. After they had been exiled to Khaibar, they \nremained waiting anxiously for the results of the skirmishes going on between the \nMuslims and the idolaters. Contrary to their hopes, the events of the war were in \nfavour of the Muslims, therefore they started a new stage of conspiracy and prepared \nthemselves to deal a deadly blow against the Muslims, but were too cowardly to \nmanoeuvre directly against them, so they laid a dreadful plan in order to achieve \ntheir objectives. Twenty chiefs of the Jews with some celebrities of Bani Nadir went \nto Makkah to negotiate an unholy alliance with Quraish. They began to goad the \npeople there to attack the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] promising them full support \nand backing. People of Quraish, who had been languid and proved too weak to \nchallenge the Muslims at Badr, seized this opportunity to redeem their stained \nhonour and blemished reputation. The same delegation set out for Ghatfan, called \nthem to do the same, and they responded positively. The Jewish delegation then \nstarted a fresh effort and toured some parts of Arabia and managed to incite the \nconfederates of disbelief against the Prophet [pbuh], his Message and the believers \nin Allâh.

They entrenched themselves in Sila‘ Mountain with the trench standing as a \nbarrier between them and the disbelievers. \nOn attempting to attack the Muslims and break into Madinah, the idolaters were \nsurprised to see a wide trench, a new stratagem unknown in Arabia before, standing \nas an obstinate obstruction. Consequently they decided to lay siege to Madinah and \nbegan to manoeuvre around the trench trying hard to find a vulnerable spot through \nwhich they could infiltrate into Madinah. To deter their enemies from approaching or \nbridging any gap in their defences, the Muslims hurled arrows, and engaged in \nskirmishes with them. The veteran fighters of Quraish were averse to this situation \nwaiting in vain in anticipation of what the siege might reveal. Therefore they decided \nthat a group of fighters led by ‘Amr bin ‘Abd-e-Wudd, ‘Ikrima bin Abi Jahl and Dirar \nbin Al-Khattab, should work its way through the trench. They, in fact, managed to do \nthat and their horsemen captured a marshy area between the trench and Sila‘ \nMountain. ‘Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel, and ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was deputed. \nAfter a short but fierce engagement, ‘Ali killed ‘Amr and obliged the others to \nevacuate in a state of panic and confusion. However, some days later, the \npolytheists conducted fresh desperate attempts but all of them failed due to Muslims’ \nsteadfastness and heroic confrontation. \n\n197\nIn the context of the events of the Trench Battle, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nfailed to observe some prayers in their right time. Jabir [R] narrated: On the Day of \nTrench ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab [R] came, cursing the disbelievers of Quraish and said: \n\"O Allâh’s Messenger! I have not offered the afternoon prayer and the sun has set.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] replied: \"By Allâh! I, too, have not offered the prayer yet.\" The \nProphet [pbuh] then went to Buthan, performed ablution and observed the afternoon \nprayer after the sun had set and then offered the sunset prayer after it.\"[Sahih Al-Bukhari \n2/590] He was so indignant for this failure that he invoked Allâh’s wrath on his enemies \nand besought Allâh to fill their houses and graves with fire because they distracted \nhim from observing the afternoon prayer. It was narrated by Ahmed and Shafa‘i that \nthe events of that battle detained him from the noon, afternoon, evening and night \nprayers, but he observed them combined. The different narrations point to the fact \nthat the situation lasted for a few days.[Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.287; Sahih Muslim 1/227] \nIt is clear that, and because of the trench standing between the two parties, no \ndirect engagement took place, but rather there were military activities confined to \narrow hurling, consequently the fight claimed the lives of a small number of fighters, \nsix Muslims and ten polytheists, one or two killed by sword. \nDuring the process of fighting, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh was shot by an arrow that pierced his \nartery. Perceiving his end approaching, he invoked Allâh saying: \"Oh, Allâh, you \nknow nothing is closer to my heart than striving in Your way against those people \n(disbelievers) who belied Your Messenger and banished him from his town. Oh, Allâh, \nI deeply believe that You have decreed that we should fight them, so if there is still \nmore fighting to go with them, let me stay alive in order to strive more against \nthem. If it has settled down, I beseech you to ignite it again so that I breathe my \nlast in its context.\"[Sahih Al-Bukhari 3/591] He concluded his supplication beseeching Allâh \nnot to let him die until he had had full revenge on Banu Quraiza. In the midst of \nthese difficult circumstances, plottery and intrigues were in fervent action against the \nMuslims. The chief criminal of Bani Nadir, Huyai, headed for the habitations of Banu \nQuraiza to incite their chief Ka‘b bin Asad Al-Qurazi, who had drawn a pact with the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] to run to his aid in times of war. Ka‘b, in the beginning \nresisted all Huyai’s temptation, but Huyai was clever enough to manipulate him, \nspeaking of Quraish and their notables in Al-Asyal, as well as Ghatfan and their \nchieftains entrenched in Uhud, all in one mind, determined to exterminate \nMuhammad [pbuh] and his followers.

On the \nauthority of Ibn Ishaq, Safiyah [R], daughter of ‘Abdul Muttalib happened to be in a \ngarrison with Hassan bin Thabit as well as some women and children. Safiyah said: \n\"A Jew was spotted lurking around our site, which was vulnerable to any enemy \nattacks because there were no men to defend it. I informed Hassan that I was \nsuspicious of that man’s presence near us. He might take us by surprise now that the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] and the Muslims are too busy to come to our aid, why \ndon’t you get down and kill him? Hassan answered that he would not do it, so I took \na bar of wood, went down and struck the Jew to death. I returned and asked Hassan \nto loot him but again Hassan refused to do that.[ibid 2/228] This event had a far reaching \neffect and discouraged the Jews from conducting further attacks thinking that those \nsites were fortified and protected by Muslim fighters.

Unfortunately the four men discovered that the \nnews was true and that the Jews announced openly that no pact of alliance existed \nany longer with Muhammad [pbuh]. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was briefed on \nthis situation, and the Muslims understood their critical position with the horrible \ndanger implied therein.

Here, Allâh says: \n\"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of \ndoubts) said, ‘Allâh and His Messenger ([pbuh]) promised us nothing but \ndelusions!’ And when a party of them said: ‘O people of Yathrib (Al-\nMadinah), there is no stand (possible) for you (against the enemy attack!) \ntherefore go back!’ And a band of them asked for permission of the Prophet \n([pbuh]) saying: ‘Truly, our homes lie open (to the enemy).’ And they lay \nnot open.

    "content": "e is to him, created something that led to the \ndissension of the enemies of Islam and later on to their full defeat. A man from the \ntribe of Ghatfan called Na‘im bin Mas‘ud asked to be admitted in the audience of the \nProphet [pbuh]. He declared that he had embraced Islam secretly and asked the \nProphet [pbuh] to order him do anything that might benefit the Muslims. The Prophet \n[pbuh] asked him to do anything that could help the Muslims in the present distress \nand use any strategem of avail. The man, in a shuttle movement, between the Jews, \nQuraish and Ghatfan managed to incite each party to let down the other. He went to \nsee the chiefs of Banu Quraiza and whispered in their ears not to trust Quraish nor \nfight with them unless the latter pledged some hostages. He tried to lend support to \nhis counsel by claiming that Quraish would forsake them if they perceived that \nvictory over Muhammad [pbuh] was far fetched, and the Muslims then would have \nterrible revenge on them. Na‘im, then headed for the camp of Quraish and managed \nto practise a similar strategem in its final result but different in content. He claimed \nthat he felt that the Jews regretted breaching their covenant with Muhammad [pbuh] \nand his followers. He told them that the Jews maintained regular correspondence \nwith the Muslims to the effect that Quraishite hostages be sent to the camp of the \nMuslims with full Jewish allegiance paid to them as already agreed upon. Na‘im then \nexhorted Quraish not to send hostages to the Jews. On a third errand, he did the \nsame with the people of Ghatfan. \nOn Saturday night, Shawwal 5 A.H., both Quraish and Ghatfan despatched envoys to \nthe Jews exhorting them to go into war against Muhammad [pbuh]. The Jews sent \nback messages that they would not fight on Saturday. They added that they needed \nhostages from them to guarantee their consistency. On receiving the replies, Quraish \nand Ghatfan came to believe Na‘im’s words fully. Therefore, they sent a message to \nthe Jews again inviting them to war and asking them to preclude that condition of \nhostages. Na‘im’s scheme proved successful, and a state of distrust and suspicion \namong the disbelieving allies prevailed and reduced their morale to deplorable \ndegree. \nMeanwhile, the Muslims were preoccupied supplicating their Lord to protect their \nhomes and provide security for their families. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on his \npart invoked Allâh’s wrath on the Confederates supplicating: \n\"Oh, Allâh! You are quick in account, You are the sender of the Book, we \nbeseech You to defeat the confederates.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/411,2/590] \nAllâh the Glorious, the Exalted, responded to the call of the Muslims on the spot. \nCoupled with the dissension and variance that found their way into the hearts of the \ndisbelievers, forces of nature — wind, rain and cold wearied them, tents were blown \ndown, cooking vessels and other equipage overthrown. \nThat very cold night the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] despatched Hudhaifa bin Al-\nYaman to hunt around for news about the enemy.

A man from the \ntribe of Ghatfan called Na‘im bin Mas‘ud asked to be admitted in the audience of the \nProphet [pbuh]. He declared that he had embraced Islam secretly and asked the \nProphet [pbuh] to order him do anything that might benefit the Muslims. The Prophet \n[pbuh] asked him to do anything that could help the Muslims in the present distress \nand use any strategem of avail. The man, in a shuttle movement, between the Jews, \nQuraish and Ghatfan managed to incite each party to let down the other. He went to \nsee the chiefs of Banu Quraiza and whispered in their ears not to trust Quraish nor \nfight with them unless the latter pledged some hostages. He tried to lend support to \nhis counsel by claiming that Quraish would forsake them if they perceived that \nvictory over Muhammad [pbuh] was far fetched, and the Muslims then would have \nterrible revenge on them. Na‘im, then headed for the camp of Quraish and managed \nto practise a similar strategem in its final result but different in content. He claimed \nthat he felt that the Jews regretted breaching their covenant with Muhammad [pbuh] \nand his followers. He told them that the Jews maintained regular correspondence \nwith the Muslims to the effect that Quraishite hostages be sent to the camp of the \nMuslims with full Jewish allegiance paid to them as already agreed upon. Na‘im then \nexhorted Quraish not to send hostages to the Jews. On a third errand, he did the \nsame with the people of Ghatfan. \nOn Saturday night, Shawwal 5 A.H., both Quraish and Ghatfan despatched envoys to \nthe Jews exhorting them to go into war against Muhammad [pbuh]. The Jews sent \nback messages that they would not fight on Saturday. They added that they needed \nhostages from them to guarantee their consistency. On receiving the replies, Quraish \nand Ghatfan came to believe Na‘im’s words fully. Therefore, they sent a message to \nthe Jews again inviting them to war and asking them to preclude that condition of \nhostages. Na‘im’s scheme proved successful, and a state of distrust and suspicion \namong the disbelieving allies prevailed and reduced their morale to deplorable \ndegree. \nMeanwhile, the Muslims were preoccupied supplicating their Lord to protect their \nhomes and provide security for their families. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on his \npart invoked Allâh’s wrath on the Confederates supplicating: \n\"Oh, Allâh! You are quick in account, You are the sender of the Book, we \nbeseech You to defeat the confederates.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/411,2/590] \nAllâh the Glorious, the Exalted, responded to the call of the Muslims on the spot. \nCoupled with the dissension and variance that found their way into the hearts of the \ndisbelievers, forces of nature — wind, rain and cold wearied them, tents were blown \ndown, cooking vessels and other equipage overthrown. \nThat very cold night the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] despatched Hudhaifa bin Al-\nYaman to hunt around for news about the enemy. He found out that they were \npreparing to leave frustrated for their inability to achieve their target. Allâh did really \nfulfill His Promise, spared the Muslims fighting a formidable army, supported His \nslave (Muhammad [pbuh]) and inflicted a heavy blow on the Confederates. \n\n200\nThe battle of the Trench took place in the fifth year Hijri.

No bitter fighting was recorded; \nnevertheless, it was one of the most decisive battles in the early history of Islam and \nproved beyond a shadow of doubt that no forces, however huge, could ever \nexterminate the nascent Islamic power growing steadily in Madinah.

As for the spoils of the war, the \nProphet [pbuh] divided them, after putting a fifth aside, in accordance with Allâh’s \ninjunctions. Three shares went to the horseman and one to the infantry fighter. \nWomen captives were sent to Najd to be bartered with horses and weaponry. For \nhimself, the Prophet [pbuh] selected Rehana bint ‘Amr bin Khanaqah, manumitted \nand married her in the year 6 Hijri.

In response to his \nsupplication ‘Aishah [R] narrated, Sa‘d’s wounds began to bleed from the front part \nof his neck while he was in his tent which the Prophet [pbuh] had pitched for him in \nthe mosque so that he would be in close proximity in order to inquire about and \nwatch his well-being closely. The people were not scared except when the blood \nflowed towards them, and in the Mosque along with Sa‘d’s tent, there was the tent of \nBanu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from \nyou? Lo! it was Sa‘d’s wound that was bleeding and he died thereon.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/591] \nJabir narrated that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had said: \"The Throne of the \nCompassionate shook for the death of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/536; Sahih Muslim 2/294; \nJami' At-Tirmidhi 2/225]\" When his bier was carried, At-Tirmidhi said: The hypocrites alleged \nit was too light. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] retorted: \n\"The angels are carrying him.\" \nIn the process of the sieze laid to Banu Quraiza, one man of the Muslims, Khallad bin \nSuwaid was killed when a women of the Jews dropped the grinding stone on him, \nand another, Abu Sinan bin Mihsan, the brother of ‘Ukasha, died. \nAbu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights.

    "content": "Confederates and Quraiza, the \nProphet [pbuh] began to despatch punitive expeditions to force the aggressive tribes \nand rebellious Arabians to come to peaceful terms with the rising state of Islam. \nA platoon of thirty believers under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was \ndespatched on a military mission in Muharram, the sixth year Hijri, following the two \nprevious battles. It headed for the habitation of Bani Bakr sept. The Muslims \nattacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. Plenty of spoils fell to the lot \nof the Muslims who returned home with a terrible disbeliever, Thumamah bin Uthal \nAl-Hanafi, chief of Bani Hanifa, who had gone out by order of Musailama, the Liar[As-\nSeerah Al-Halabiyah 2/297], to assassinate the Prophet [pbuh]. The Prophet’s Companions \ntied him to a pole of the Prophetic Mosque. To a question posed by the Prophet \n[pbuh], Thumamah used to say: \"If you were to kill someone, then you would have \nto choose one of noble descent, if you were to be gracious, then let it be to a grateful \nman and if you were to ask for money, you would have to ask for it from a generous \nman.\" He repeated that three times on three different occasions. On the third time, \nthe Prophet [pbuh] ordered that he should be released. He soon went nearby, \nwashed and then came back to profess the new faith addressing the Prophet [pbuh]: \n\"No face had been more awful to me than yours but now it is the closest to my \nheart, no religion had ever been more repugnant to me than yours, now it is the \ndearest in my heart. Now I want to perform the ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage).\" The \nProphet [pbuh] gave him good tidings and asked him to do that. On his arrival in \nMakkah, the Quraishites accused him of apostasy. He denied it and affirmed that he \n\n205\nhad embraced Islam, and then swore that they would never get a grain from \nYamama, a suburban area around Makkah, unless the Prophet [pbuh] would allow it. \nIn fact, he did it and refused to send food supplies to Makkah until the Prophet \n[pbuh] interceded at the Makkans’ earnest plea.[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/119; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool, \np.292-293] \nBani Lihyan Invasion \nBani Lihyan had acted treacherously towards ten of the Prophet’s Companions and \nhad them hanged. Their habitation being situated deep in the heart of Hijaz on the \nborders of Makkah, and due to deep-seated blood-revenge between the Muslims on \nthe one hand, and Quraish and the Arabians on the other, the Prophet [pbuh] \ndeemed it unwise to penetrate deep and come close to the greatest enemy, Quraish. \nHowever, when the power of the allied Confederates collapsed and they began to \nslacken and resign to the current unfavourable balance of power, the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] seized this rare opportunity and decided that it was time to take \nrevenge on Bani Lihyan. He set out in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal or Jumada Al-Ula in the year \nsix Hijri at the head of two hundred Muslim fighters and made a feint of heading for \nSyria, then soon changed route towards Batn Gharran, the scene of his Companions’ \ntragedy, and invoked Allâh’s mercy on them. News of his march reached Bani Lihyan, \nwho immediately fled to the mountain tops nearby and thus remained out of his \nreach. On his way back, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched a group of ten horsemen to \na place called Kura‘ Al-Ghamim, in the vicinity of the habitation of Quraish in order to \nindirectly confirm his growing military power. All these skirmishes took fourteen \ndays, after which he left back for home. \nExpeditions and Delegations continued \n1. A platoon led by ‘Ukasha bin Al-Mihsan was despatched to a place called Al-\nGhamir inhabited by Bani Asad in the year six Hijri. The enemy immediately \nfled leaving behind them two hundred camels which were taken to Madinah. \n2. A platoon led by Muhammad bin Maslamah set out towards the habitation of \nBani Tha‘labah in Dhil Qassa. But a hundred men of the enemies ambushed \nand killed all of them except Muhammad bin Maslamah who managed to \nescape but badly wounded. \n3. In retaliation against Bani Tha‘labah, Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah, at the head \nof forty men, was despatched to Dhil Qassa. They walked that night and took \nthe enemy by surprise in the morning. Again, they fled to the mountains \nexcept one who was injured, and later embraced Islam. A lot of booty fell to \ntheir lot in that particular incident. \n4. A platoon, under the leadership of Zaid bin Haritha, was sent to Al-Jumum, \nthe habitation of Bani Saleem, in the same year. A woman from Bani Muzaina \nshowed them the way to the enemy’s camp. There the Muslims took some \ncaptives and gained a lot of booty. Later on, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \ngranted the woman her freedom and married her to one of his followers. \n5. Zaid bin Haritha, in Jumada Al-Ula 6 Hijri, at the head of a hundred and \nseventy horsemen, set out to a place called Al-‘Ais, intercepted a caravan of \nQuraish led by Abul-‘As, the Prophet’s relative and looted their camels. Abul-\n‘As escaped and took refuge in Zainab’s (his wife and the Prophet’s daughter) \nhouse. He begged her to ask the Prophet [pbuh] for the restitution of his \nwealth. The Prophet [pbuh] recommended, but without coercion, that the \n\n206\npeople do that. They immediately gave the man back all his wealth. He went \nback to Makkah, gave over the trusts to those entitled to them, embraced \nIslam and emigrated to Madinah where the Prophet [pbuh] reunited him with \nhis wife, Zainab, after three and a half years of their first marriage contract. \nThe verse relating to prohibition of marriage between women Muslims and \ndisbelievers had not been revealed then. \n6. In Jumada Ath-Thania, the same year, Zaid at the head of fifteen men raided \nBani Tha‘labah and captured twenty of their camels but the people had fled. \n7. In Rajab of the same year, Zaid, at the head of twelve men, set out to a place \ncalled Wadi Al-Qura in a reconnaissance mission to explore the movements of \nthe enemy. The people there attacked the Muslims, killed nine of them, while \nthe rest including Zaid bin Haritha managed to escape.[Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 2/226; Za'd \nAl-Ma'ad 2/120-122] \n8. The invasion of Al-Khabt (diluted yoghurt) took place in the year eight Hijri \ni.e. before Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty. Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah led three \nhundred horsemen to observe a caravan belonging to Quraish. Because of the \ninadequacy of food supplies, they began to starve so much that they had \nKhabt (diluted yoghurt), hence the appellation \"The Army of Al-Khabt\". One of \nthe men slaughtered nine camels at three times, three each time at different \nstages of the mission. Abu ‘Ubaidah, the leader of the campaign prohibited \nhim from doing so. The sea was generous and presented them with an animal \ncalled Al-‘Anbar (sperm-whale) so rich in fat that they subsisted on it for half \na month. When they came back home, they narrated the story to the Prophet \n[pbuh], who commented that it was provision granted by Allâh, and asked \nthem to share him some of its meat.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/625,626; Sahih Muslim 2/145,146] \nThis campaign came chronologically prior to Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty",

Following the battle of \nBadr, he made pretensions of being a Muslim, but deep at heart, he remained that \nterrible enemy of Allâh, His Messenger; and all the believers, in general. His sole \ntarget had always been to sow the seeds of dissension in the Muslim community, and \nundermine the cause of the new heavenly religion it has. His treacherous behaviour \ncould be witnessed everywhere but was strikingly evident in his wicked attempts at \ncreating a state of confusion and disorder amongst the Muslims at Uhud Battle. His \nhypocrisy and deceit assumed serious and ugly dimensions when he used to stand \nup among the Muslims shortly before the Prophet’s Friday speech, and mockingly say \nto them: \"This is the Messenger of Allâh, who has honoured you with Allâh, so you \nhave got to support, obey and listen to him,\" and then he would sit down. \nHe did the same following Uhud Battle on Friday. He was so rude and presumptuous \nthat his words smacked unmistakingly of deeply-rooted rancour, so that some of the \nMuslims took him by his cloak reproachingly and silenced him. He immediately left, \nuttering rude and mocking words. A Helper met him at the Mosque gate and ordered \nhim to return and beg the Messenger for Allâh’s forgiveness, but he retorted that he \n\n208\nhad never wanted him to ask for that.[Ibn Hisham 2/105] He, moreover, conducted \nclandestine contacts with Bani Nadir, another tribe of Jews, encouraging them to \nmake alliance with him and promising support for them; all of this in his ceaseless \nefforts in a long process of conspiracy and intrigue hatched against the Muslims. \nAllâh’s Words as regards his treacherous acts and awe-inspiring attempts during the \nTrench Battle came to testify quite clearly to this mode of hypocrisy: \n\"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of \ndoubts) said: ‘Allâh and His Messenger ([pbuh]) promised us nothing but \ndelusions!\" [Al-Qur'an 33:12] \nThe verses go on in the same context to describe the hypocrite as a coward and a \ndefeatist. He is a liar and has no regard for pledges solemnly made. He is \ntreacherous, disloyal and perfidious. He is niggardly and greedy. In short, he is the \ncomplete antithesis of a true believer: \n\"They think that Al-Ahzab (the Confederates) have not yet withdrawn, and \nif Al-Ahzab (the Confederates) should come (again), they would wish they \nwere in the deserts (wandering) among the bedouins, seeking news about \nyou (from a far place); and if they (happen) to be among you, they would \nnot fight but little.\" [Al-Qur'an 33:20] \nAll enemies of Islam from the Jews, hypocrites and polytheists did acknowledge that \nIslam had the upper hand not because of material superiority, multitudes of troops \nor much equipment; but it was rather due to the noble values, refined ethics and \nhigh attributes that imbued the Muslim community and whoever was attached to it. \nThe enemies of Islam were already aware of that flood of light der",

    "content": "against the new \nreligion for five years, came to realize fully that exterminating Islam is not accessible \nin the battlefields, so they resorted to other tactics. They, being reputed gossip-\nmongers, decided to launch a widespread propaganda campaign aiming at slandering \nthe person of the Prophet [pbuh] in a most sensitive area of the Arabian life, namely \nethics and traditions. Following the battle of the Confederates, the Prophet [pbuh] \nmarried Zainab bint Jahsh after her marriage with Zaid bin Haritha, his adopted son, \nhad broken up. They seized this opportunity and began to circulate idle talk against \nthe Prophet [pbuh] in Arabia depending on a tradition among the desert Arabs that \nprohibits contracting a marriage with an adopted son’s divorcee. They alleged that \nhis marriage would be considered a heinous sin. They also based their malicious \npropaganda on the fact that Zainab was his fifth wife whereas the number was \nstrictly limited to a maximum of four in the Noble Qur’ân, hence the validity of this \nmarriage was in doubt, according to them. \nThese rumours and gossips had a negative impact on the morale of some weak-\nhearted Muslims until the decisive verses were revealed acquitting the Prophet \n[pbuh] and invalidating all those ill designs and obnoxious schemes: \n\"O Prophet (Muhammad [pbuh])! Keep your duty to Allâh, and obey not the \ndisbelievers and the hypocrites (i.e. do not follow their advices). Verily! \nAllâh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.\" [Al-Qur'an 33:1] \n\n209\n The wicked Role they played in the course of the Ghazwah of Bani Al-Mustaliq \nDuring this Ghazwah, the hypocrites almost managed to create a sort of discord \namong the Muslims themselves, coupled with a serious and ugly slander against the \nProphet [pbuh] himself. In short, their behaviour was an authentic translation of \nAllâh’s Words: \n\"Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing \nexcept disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst \n(spreading corruption) and sowing sedition among you …\" [Al-Qur'an 9:47] \nA quarrel was about to break out between the Emigrants and the Helpers on account \nof plots and evil intentions designed by the hypocrites. The Prophet [pbuh] told them \noff describing their misbehaviour as something smacking of pre-Islamic practices. \nThey, hypocrites with ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ubai at their head, were furious for the challenge \nwhich the Muslims showed towards the hostile plans and vicious intrigues woven \nbehind closed doors, and swore \"the most honourable will expel the meanest out of \nMadinah,\" and added: \"They (the Muslims) have outnumbered and shared us our \nland. If you fatten your dog, it will eat you.\" When that talk was reported to the \nProphet [pbuh], ‘Umar, a venerable Companion, asked for permission to have Ibn \n‘Ubai killed. The Prophet [pbuh] naturally turned down his proposal on the grounds \nthat it did not become of a Prophet [pbuh] to be accused of killing his people. He, on \nthe contrary in an unexpected move, asked ‘Umar to announce departure. He \nmarched with his men for two days until the sun grew too hot. They stopped and fell \nasleep, a clever attempt at diverting his people’s attention from the previous event. \n‘Abdullah’s son heard of that vile of his father and as the party reached Madinah, he \ndrew his sword and barred his father’s entry into the town until he had confessed \nand declared that he himself was the meanest of the citizens of Madinah and the \nProphet [pbuh] the most honourable of them. Thus the boast recoiled on his head. It \nwas also reported that the son was ready to kill his father if the Prophet [pbuh] had \nwanted him to. \nThe Slander Affair \nThis extremely painful incident took place on the Prophet’s return from the \nexpedition against Bani Mustaliq. The Muslim army had to halt for a night at a place, \na short distance from Madinah. In this expedition, the Prophet [pbuh] was \naccompanied by his noble and talented wife, ‘Aishah [R]. As it so happened, ‘Aishah \n[R] went out some distance from the camp to attend to the call of nature. When she \nreturned, she discovered that she had dropped her necklace somewhere. The \nnecklace itself was of no great value, but as it was a loan from a friend, ‘Aishah [R] \nwent out again to search for it. On her return, to her great grief and mortification, \nthe army had already marched away with the camel she was riding, her attendants \nthinking that she was in the litter as she was then thin, very young and light of \nweight. In her helplessness she sat down and cried till sleep overpowered her. \nSafwan bin Mu‘attal, an Emigrant, who was coming in the rear recognized her as he \nhad seen her before the verse enjoining the veil was revealed, and brought her on \nhis camel to Madinah without saying a single word to her, himself walking behind the \nanimal. The hypocrites of Madinah led by ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ubai bin Salul, sought to \nmake capital out of this incident and spread a malicious scandal against ‘Aishah [R] \nand unfortunately some of the Muslims also became involved in it. On arrival in \nMadinah, the Prophet [pbuh] held counsel with his Companions, who pronounced \n\n210\ndifferent opinions ranging from divorce to retention. The incident almost roused a \nfight between two rival factions, Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, but the Prophet’s \nintervention silenced both parties on the sport. ‘Aishah [R], unaware of the rumours \nbeing circulated, fell ill and was confined to bed for a month. On recovering, she \nheard of the slander and took permission to go and see her parents seeking \nauthentic news. She then burst into tears and stayed for two days and one sleepless \nnight ceaselessly weeping to such an extent that she felt her liver was about to rip \nopen. The Prophet [pbuh] visited her in that situation, and after testifying to the \nOneness of Allâh he told her, \"If you are innocent, Allâh will acquit you, otherwise, \nyou have to beg for His forgiveness and pardon.\" She stopped weeping and asked \nher parents to speak for her, but they had nothing to say, so she herself took the \ninitiative and said \"Should I tell you I am innocent, and Allâh knows that I am surely \ninnocent, you will not believe me; and if I were to admit something of which, Allâh \nknows, I am innocent, you will believe me, then I will have nothing to make recourse \nto except the words of the father of Prophet Yusuf (Joseph): \n\"So (for me) patience is most fitting. And it is Allâh (Alone) Whose Help can \nbe sought against that which you assert.\" [Al-Qur'an 12:18] \nShe then turned away and lay down for some rest. At that decisive moment the \nRevelation came acquitting ‘Aishah [R] of all the slanderous talk fabricated in this \nconcern. ‘Aishah [R], of course, was wholeheartedly joyful and praised Allâh \nthankfully. Allâh’s Words in this regard went as follows: \n\"Verily! Those who brought forth the slander (against ‘Aishah [R] — the \nwife of the Prophet [pbuh]) are a group among you.\" [Al-Qur'an 24:11] \nThe principal elements involved in the slander affair, Mistah bin Athatha, Hassan bin \nThabit and Hamnah bint Jahsh, were flogged with eighty stripes. \nAs for the man who took the principal part, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai, he was not flogged, \neither because the corporal punishment commutes the chastisement in store for him \nin the Hereafter, and he does not deserve this merit, or for the same public interest \nfor which he was not killed previously. He, moreover, became the butt of reproach \nand humiliation amongst his people after his real intentions had been unequivocally \nexposed to all the public. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/364,2/696-698; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/113-115; Ibn Hisham 2/297-307] \nAlmost a month later, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab were \nengaged in the following talk: \"Don’t you see ‘Umar if I had had him (Abdullah bin \nUbai) killed, a large number of dignitaries would have furiously hastened to fight for \nhim. Now, on the contrary, if I ask them to kill him, they will do so out of their own \nfree will.\" ‘Umar replied \"I swear by Allâh that the Prophet’s judgement is much more \nsound than",
    "enhanced_text": "against the new \nreligion for five years, came to realize fully that exterminating Islam is not accessible \nin the battlefields, so they resorted to other tactics. They, being reputed gossip-\nmongers, decided to launch a widespread propaganda campaign aiming at slandering \nthe person of the Prophet [pbuh] in a most sensitive area of the Arabian life, namely \nethics and traditions. Following the battle of the Confederates, the Prophet [pbuh] \nmarried Zainab bint Jahsh after her marriage with Zaid bin Haritha, his adopted son, \nhad broken up. They seized this opportunity and began to circulate idle talk against \nthe Prophet [pbuh] in Arabia depending on a tradition among the desert Arabs that \nprohibits contracting a marriage with an adopted son’s divorcee. They alleged that \nhis marriage would be considered a heinous sin. They also based their malicious \npropaganda on the fact that Zainab was his fifth wife whereas the number was \nstrictly limited to a maximum of four in the Noble Qur’ân, hence the validity of this \nmarriage was in doubt, according to them. \nThese rumours and gossips had a negative impact on the morale of some weak-\nhearted Muslims until the decisive verses were revealed acquitting the Prophet \n[pbuh] and invalidating all those ill designs and obnoxious schemes: \n\"O Prophet (Muhammad [pbuh])! Keep your duty to Allâh, and obey not the \ndisbelievers and the hypocrites (i.e. do not follow their advices). Verily! \nAllâh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.\" [Al-Qur'an 33:1] \n\n209\n The wicked Role they played in the course of the Ghazwah of Bani Al-Mustaliq \nDuring this Ghazwah, the hypocrites almost managed to create a sort of discord \namong the Muslims themselves, coupled with a serious and ugly slander against the \nProphet [pbuh] himself. In short, their behaviour was an authentic translation of \nAllâh’s Words: \n\"Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing \nexcept disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst \n(spreading corruption) and sowing sedition among you …\" [Al-Qur'an 9:47] \nA quarrel was about to break out between the Emigrants and the Helpers on account \nof plots and evil intentions designed by the hypocrites. The Prophet [pbuh] told them \noff describing their misbehaviour as something smacking of pre-Islamic practices. \nThey, hypocrites with ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ubai at their head, were furious for the challenge \nwhich the Muslims showed towards the hostile plans and vicious intrigues woven \nbehind closed doors, and swore \"the most honourable will expel the meanest out of \nMadinah,\" and added: \"They (the Muslims) have outnumbered and shared us our \nland. If you fatten your dog, it will eat you.\" When that talk was reported to the \nProphet [pbuh], ‘Umar, a venerable Companion, asked for permission to have Ibn \n‘Ubai killed. The Prophet [pbuh] naturally turned down his proposal on the grounds \nthat it did not become of a Prophet [pbuh] to be accused of killing his people. He, on \nthe contrary in an unexpected move, asked ‘Umar to announce departure. He \nmarched with his men for two days until the sun grew too hot. They stopped and fell \nasleep, a clever attempt at diverting his people’s attention from the previous event. \n‘Abdullah’s son heard of that vile of his father and as the party reached Madinah, he \ndrew his sword and barred his father’s entry into the town until he had confessed \nand declared that he himself was the meanest of the citizens of Madinah and the \nProphet [pbuh] the most honourable of them. Thus the boast recoiled on his head. It \nwas also reported that the son was ready to kill his father if the Prophet [pbuh] had \nwanted him to. \nThe Slander Affair \nThis extremely painful incident took place on the Prophet’s return from the \nexpedition against Bani Mustaliq.

Some of them were killed and others captured. \nAmongst the captives, were Umm Qirfa and her beautiful daughter, who was \nsent to Makkah as a ransom for the release of some Muslim prisoners there.[] \nUmm Qirfa’s attempts at the Prophet’s life recoiled on her, and the thirty \nhorsemen she had gathered and sustained to implement her evil scheme \nwere all killed. \n4. Anas bin Malik reported that some people belonging to tribe of ‘Uraina came \nto Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] and made pretensions to Islam. They stayed in \nMadinah but found its climate uncongenial, so they were asked to pitch their \ntents in the pastures nearby. They did so and were all right. They then fell on \nthe Prophet’s shepherd and killed him, turned apostates from Islam and drove \noff the camels. This news reached the Prophet [pbuh] , who sent a group of \ntwenty Muslims led by Karz bin Jabir Al-Fihri on their track. They were \nbrought and handed over to him. He had their hands and feet cut off, their \neyes gouged out in recompense for their behaviour, and then they were \nthrown on the stony ground until they died. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/122] \nBiographers also reported ‘Amr bin Omaiya Ad-Damari and Salamah bin Abi \nSalamah to have been sent on an errand to kill Abu Sufyan, the chief of \nQuraish, who had already sent a bedouin to kill the Prophet [pbuh]. The two-\nmen mission failed except for three polytheists killed on the way. It is \nnoteworthy that all the foregone invasions did not imply real bitter fighting, \nthey were rather skirmishes or punitive military manoeuvres carried out to \ndeter some enemies still unsubdued. Deep meditation on the development of \nwar circumstances reveal the continuous collap",

The Muslims reported thirst to the Prophet [pbuh], who took an \narrow out of his quiver, and placed it in the ditch. Water immediately gushed forth, \nand his followers drank to their fill. When the Prophet [pbuh] had rested, Budail bin \nWarqa’ Al-Khuza‘i with some celebrities of Khuza‘ah tribe, the Prophet’s confidants, \ncame and asked him what he had come for. The Prophet [pbuh] replied that it was \nnot for war that he had come forth: \"I have no other design,\" he said, \"but to \nperform ‘Umrah (the lesser pilgrimage) in the Holy Sanctuary. Should Quraish \nembrace the new religion, as some people have done, they are most welcome, but if \n\n214\nthey stand in my way or debar the Muslims from pilgrimage, I will surely fight them \nto the last man, and Allâh’s Order must be fulfilled.\" The envoy carried the message \nback to Quraish, who sent another one called Mikraz bin Hafs. On seeing him, the \nProphet [pbuh] said that that was a treacherous man. He was given the same \nmessage to communicate to his people. He was followed by another ambassador \nknown as Al-Hulais bin ‘Alqamah. He was very much impressed by the spirit of \ndevotion that the Muslims had for the Sacred Ka‘bah. He went back to his men and \nwarned them against debarring Muhammad [pbuh] and his Companions from doing \nhonour to Allâh’s house on the peril of breaking his alliance with them. Hulais was \nsucceeded by ‘Urwa bin Mas‘ud Ath-Thaqafi to negotiate with Muhammad [pbuh]. In \nthe course of discussion he said to the Prophet [pbuh]: \"Muhammad! Have you \ngathered around yourself mixed people and then brought them against your kith and \nkin in order to destroy them. By Allâh I think I see you deserted by these people \ntomorrow.\" At this point Abu Bakr stood up and expressed his resentment at this \nimputation. Al-Mugheerah bin Shu‘bah expressed the same attitude and reprovingly \nforbade him from touching the Prophet’s beard. Here, Quraish’s envoy remarked \nindignantly and alluded to the latter’s treacherous act of killing his companions and \nlooting them before he embraced Islam. Meanwhile, ‘Urwah, during his stay in the \nMuslim camp, had been closely watching the unfathomable love and profound \nrespect that the followers of Muhammad [pbuh] showed him. He returned and \nconveyed to Quraish his impression that those people could not forsake the Prophet \n[pbuh] under any circumstances. He expressed his feelings in the following words: \"I \nhave been to Chosroes, Caesar and Negus in their kingdoms, but never have I seen \na king among a people like Muhammad [pbuh] among his Companions. If he \nperforms his ablution, they would not let the water thereof fall on the ground; if he \nexpectorates, they would have the mucus to rub their faces with; if he speaks, they \nwould lower their voices. They will not abandon him for anything in any case. He, \nnow, offers you a reasonable plan, so do what you please.\" \nSeeing an overwhelming tendency towards reconciliation among their chiefs, some \nreckless, fight-prone youngsters of Quraish devised a wicked plan that could hinder \nthe peace treaty. They decided to infiltrate into the camp of the Muslims and produce \nintentional skirmishes that might trigger the fuse of war. Muhammad bin Maslamah, \nchief of the Muslim guards, took them captives, but in view of the far-reaching \nimminent results about to be achieved, the Prophet [pbuh] set them free. In this \ncontext Allâh says: \n\"And He it is Who has withheld their hands from y",

Hulais was \nsucceeded by ‘Urwa bin Mas‘ud Ath-Thaqafi to negotiate with Muhammad [pbuh]. In \nthe course of discussion he said to the Prophet [pbuh]: \"Muhammad! Have you \ngathered around yourself mixed people and then brought them against your kith and \nkin in order to destroy them. By Allâh I think I see you deserted by these people \ntomorrow.\" At this point Abu Bakr stood up and expressed his resentment at this \nimputation. Al-Mugheerah bin Shu‘bah expressed the same attitude and reprovingly \nforbade him from touching the Prophet’s beard. Here, Quraish’s envoy remarked \nindignantly and alluded to the latter’s treacherous act of killing his companions and \nlooting them before he embraced Islam. Meanwhile, ‘Urwah, during his stay in the \nMuslim camp, had been closely watching the unfathomable love and profound \nrespect that the followers of Muhammad [pbuh] showed him. He returned and \nconveyed to Quraish his impression that those people could not forsake the Prophet \n[pbuh] under any circumstances. He expressed his feelings in the following words: \"I \nhave been to Chosroes, Caesar and Negus in their kingdoms, but never have I seen \na king among a people like Muhammad [pbuh] among his Companions. If he \nperforms his ablution, they would not let the water thereof fall on the ground; if he \nexpectorates, they would have the mucus to rub their faces with; if he speaks, they \nwould lower their voices. They will not abandon him for anything in any case. He, \nnow, offers you a reasonable plan, so do what you please.\" \nSeeing an overwhelming tendency towards reconciliation among their chiefs, some \nreckless, fight-prone youngsters of Quraish devised a wicked plan that could hinder \nthe peace treaty. They decided to infiltrate into the camp of the Muslims and produce \nintentional skirmishes that might trigger the fuse of war. Muhammad bin Maslamah, \nchief of the Muslim guards, took them captives, but in view of the far-reaching \nimminent results about to be achieved, the Prophet [pbuh] set them free. In this \ncontext Allâh says: \n\"And He it is Who has withheld their hands from y",

He was also asked to call them to Islam, and \ngive glad tidings to the believers in Makkah, women and men, that the conquest was \napproaching and Islam was surely to prevail because Allâh would verily establish His \nreligion in Makkah. ‘Uthman also assured them that after the performance of \n\n215\nceremonies they would soon depart peacefully, but the Quraishites were adamant \nand not prepared to grant them the permission to visit Al-Ka‘bah. They, however, \noffered ‘Uthman the permission to perform the pilgrimage, if he so desired in his \nindividual capacity, but ‘Uthman declined the offer saying: \"How is it possible that I \navail myself of this opportunity, when the Prophet [pbuh] is denied of it?\" The \nMuslims anxiously waited for the arrival of ‘Uthman with mingled feelings of fear and \nanxiety. But his arrival was considerably delayed and a foul play was suspected on \nthe part of Quraish. The Muslims were greatly worried and took a solemn pledge at \nthe hand of the Prophet [pbuh] that they would sacrifice their lives to avenge the \ndeath of their Companion and stand firmly by their master, Muhammad [pbuh], \nunder all conditions. This pledge goes by the name of Bay‘at Ar-Ridwan (a covenant \nof fealty). The first men to take a pledge were Abu Sinan Al-Asadi and Salamah bin \nAl-Akwa‘, who gave a solemn promise to die in the cause of Truth three times, at the \nfront of the army, in the middle and in the rear. The Prophet [pbuh] caught his left \nhand on behalf of ‘Uthman. This fealty was sworn under a tree, with ‘Umar holding \nthe Prophet’s hand and Ma‘qil bin Yasar holding a branch of the tree up. The Noble \nQur’ân has referred to this pledge in the following words: \n\"Indeed, Allâh was pleased with the believers when they gave their Bai‘a \n(pledge) to you (O Muhammad [pbuh] ) under the tree.\" [Al-Qur'an 48:18] \nWhen Quraish saw the firm determination of the Muslims to shed the last drop of \nblood for the defence of their Faith, they came to their senses and realized that \nMuhammad’s followers could not be cowed down by these tactics. After some further \ninterchange of messages they agreed to conclude a treaty of reconciliation and peace \nwith the Muslims. The clauses of the said treaty go as follows: \n1. The Muslims shall return this time and come back next year, but they shall \nnot stay in Makkah for more than three days. \n2. They shall not come back armed but can bring with them swords only \nsheathed in scabbards and these shall be kept in bags. \n3. War activities shall be suspended for ten years, during which both parties will \nlive in full security and neither will raise sword against the other. \n4. If anyone from Quraish goes over to Muhammad [pbuh] without his \nguardian’s permission, he should be sent back to Quraish, but should any of \nMuhammad’s followers return to Quraish, he shall not be sent back. \n5.

On the one hand, Abu Jandal was lamenting at the top of his \nvoice, \"Am I to be returned to the polytheists that they might entice me from my \nreligion, O Muslims!\" but, on the other hand, the faithful engagement was also \nconsidered to be necessary, above all other considerations. The Prophet’s heart \nwelled up with sympathy, but he wanted to honour his word at all costs. He consoled \nAbu Jandal and said, \"Be patient, resign yourself to the Will of Allâh. Allâh is going to \nprovide for you and your helpless companions relief and means of escape. We have \nconcluded a treaty of peace with them and we have taken the pledge in the Name of \nAllâh. We are, therefore, under no circumstances prepared to break it.\" ‘Umar bin Al-\nKhattab could",

    "content": "splendid results of the peace \ntreaty which Allâh called \"a manifest victory\". How could it be otherwise when \nQuraish had recognized the legitimate Muslims’ existence on the scene of political life \nin Arabia, and began to deal with the believers on equal terms. Quraish in the light of \nthe articles of the treaty, had indirectly relinquished its claim to religious leadership, \nand admitted that they were no longer interested in people other than Quraish, and \nwashed their hands of any sort of intervention in the religious future of the Arabian \nPeninsula. The Muslims did not have in mind to seize people’s property or kill them \nthrough bloody wars, nor did they ever think of pursuing any coercive approaches in \ntheir endeavours to propagate Islam, on the contrary, their sole target was to \nprovide an atmosphere of freedom as regards ideology or religion: \n\"Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him \ndisbelieve.\" [Al-Qur'an 18:29] \nThe Muslims, on the other hand, had the opportunity to spread Islam over areas not \nthen explored. When there was armistice, war was abolished, and men met and \nconsulted together, none talked about Islam intelligently without entering it; within \nthe two years following the conclusion of the treaty double as many entered Islam as \never before. This is supported by the fact that the Prophet [pbuh] went out to Al-\nHudaibiyah with only 1,400 men, but when he set out to liberate Makkah, two years \nlater, he had 10,000 men with him. \n\n218\nThe article of the treaty pertaining to cessation of hostilities for ten years points \ndirectly to the utter failure of political haughtiness exercised by Quraish and its allies, \nand functions as evidence of the collapse and impotence of the war instigator. \nQuraish had been obliged to lose those advantages in return for one seemingly in its \nfavour but does not actually bear any harm against the Muslims, i.e., the article that \nspeaks of handing over believing men who seek refuge with the Muslims without \ntheir guardians’ consent to Quraish. At first glance, it was a most distressing clause \nand was considered objectionable in the Muslim camp. However, in the course of \nevents, it proved to be a great blessing. The Muslims sent back to Makkah were not \nlikely to renounce the blessings of Islam; contrariwise, those very Muslims turned \nout to be centres of influence for Islam. It was impossible to think that they would \nbecome apostates or renegades. The wisdom behind this truce assumed its full \ndimensions in some subsequent events. After the Prophet [pbuh] had reached \nMadinah, Abu Baseer, who had escaped from Quraish, came to him as a Muslim; \nQuraish sent two men demanding his return, so the Prophet [pbuh] handed him over \nto them. On the way to Makkah, Abu Baseer managed to kill one of them, and the \nother one fled to Madinah with Abu Baseer in pursuit. When he reached the Prophet \n[pbuh], he said, \"Your obligation is over and Allâh has freed you from it. You duly \nhanded me over to the men, and Allâh has rescued me from them.\" The Prophet \n[pbuh] said, \"Woe is his mother, he would have kindled a war if there had been \nothers with him.\" When he heard that, he knew that he would be handed back to \nthem, so he fled from Madinah and went as far as Saif Al-Bahr. The other Muslims \nwho were oppressed in Makkah began to escape to Abu Baseer. He was joined by \nAbu Jandal and others until a fair-sized colony was formed and soon sought revenge \non Quraish and started to intercept their caravans. The pagans of Makkah finding \nthemselves unable to control those exiled colonists, begged the Prophet [pbuh] to do \naway with the clause which governed the extradition. They implored him by Allâh \nand by their ties of kinship to send for the group, saying that whoever joined the \nMuslims in Madinah would be safe from them. So the Prophet [pbuh] sent for the \ngroup and they responded, as expected, positively. \nThese are the realities of the clauses of the truce treaty and as it seems they all \nfunction in favour of the nascent Islamic state. However, two points in the treaty \nmade it distasteful to some Muslims, namely they were not given access to the Holy \nSanctuary that year, and the seemingly humiliating attitude as regards reconciliation \nwith the pagans of Quraish. ‘Umar, unable to contain himself for the distress taking \nfull grasp of his heart, went to the Prophet [pbuh] and said: \"Aren’t you the true \nMessenger of Allâh?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied calmly, \"Why not?\" ‘Umar again \nspoke and asked: \"Aren’t we on the path of righteousness and our enemies in the \nwrong?\" Without showing any resentment, the Prophet [pbuh] replied that it was so. \nOn getting this reply he further urged: \"Then we should not suffer any humiliation in \nthe matter of Faith.\" The Prophet [pbuh] was unruffled and with perfect confidence \nsaid: \"I am the true Messenger of Allâh, I never disobey Him, He shall help me.\" \"Did \nyou not tell us,\" rejoined ‘Umar, \"that we shall perform pilgrimage?\" \"But I have \nnever told you,\" replied the Prophet [pbuh], \"that we shall do so this very year.\" \n‘Umar was silenced. But his mind was disturbed. He went to Abu Bakr and expressed \nhis feelings before him. Abu Bakr who had never been in doubt as regards the \nProphet’s truthfulness and veracity confirmed what the Prophet [pbuh] had told him. \nIn due course the Chapter of Victory (48th) was revealed saying: \n\n219\n\"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) a manifest victory.\" [Al-\nQur'an 48:1] \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned ‘Umar and imported to him the happy \ntidings. ‘Umar was overjoyed, and greatly regretted his former attitude. He used to \nspend in charity, observe fasting and prayer and free as many slaves as possible in \nexpiation for that reckless attitude he had assumed. [Fath Al-Bari 7/439-458; Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/378-\n381] \nThe early part of the year 7 A.H. witnessed the Islamization of three prominent men \nof Makkah, ‘Amr bin Al-‘As, Khalid bin Al-Waleed and ‘Uthman bin Talhah. On their \narrival and entrance into the fold of Islam, the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"Quraish has \ngiven us its own blood",

You duly \nhanded me over to the men, and Allâh has rescued me from them.\" The Prophet \n[pbuh] said, \"Woe is his mother, he would have kindled a war if there had been \nothers with him.\" When he heard that, he knew that he would be handed back to \nthem, so he fled from Madinah and went as far as Saif Al-Bahr. The other Muslims \nwho were oppressed in Makkah began to escape to Abu Baseer. He was joined by \nAbu Jandal and others until a fair-sized colony was formed and soon sought revenge \non Quraish and started to intercept their caravans. The pagans of Makkah finding \nthemselves unable to control those exiled colonists, begged the Prophet [pbuh] to do \naway with the clause which governed the extradition. They implored him by Allâh \nand by their ties of kinship to send for the group, saying that whoever joined the \nMuslims in Madinah would be safe from them. So the Prophet [pbuh] sent for the \ngroup and they responded, as expected, positively. \nThese are the realities of the clauses of the truce treaty and as it seems they all \nfunction in favour of the nascent Islamic state. However, two points in the treaty \nmade it distasteful to some Muslims, namely they were not given access to the Holy \nSanctuary that year, and the seemingly humiliating attitude as regards reconciliation \nwith the pagans of Quraish. ‘Umar, unable to contain himself for the distress taking \nfull grasp of his heart, went to the Prophet [pbuh] and said: \"Aren’t you the true \nMessenger of Allâh?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied calmly, \"Why not?\" ‘Umar again \nspoke and asked: \"Aren’t we on the path of righteousness and our enemies in the \nwrong?\" Without showing any resentment, the Prophet [pbuh] replied that it was so. \nOn getting this reply he further urged: \"Then we should not suffer any humiliation in \nthe matter of Faith.\" The Prophet [pbuh] was unruffled and with perfect confidence \nsaid: \"I am the true Messenger of Allâh, I never disobey Him, He shall help me.\" \"Did \nyou not tell us,\" rejoined ‘Umar, \"that we shall perform pilgrimage?\" \"But I have \nnever told you,\" replied the Prophet [pbuh], \"that we shall do so this very year.\" \n‘Umar was silenced. But his mind was disturbed. He went to Abu Bakr and expressed \nhis feelings before him. Abu Bakr who had never been in doubt as regards the \nProphet’s truthfulness and veracity confirmed what the Prophet [pbuh] had told him. \nIn due course the Chapter of Victory (48th) was revealed saying: \n\n219\n\"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) a manifest victory.\" [Al-\nQur'an 48:1] \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned ‘Umar and imported to him the happy \ntidings. ‘Umar was overjoyed, and greatly regretted his former attitude. He used to \nspend in charity, observe fasting and prayer and free as many slaves as possible in \nexpiation for that reckless attitude he had assumed. [Fath Al-Bari 7/439-458; Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/378-\n381] \nThe early part of the year 7 A.H. witnessed the Islamization of three prominent men \nof Makkah, ‘Amr bin Al-‘As, Khalid bin Al-Waleed and ‘Uthman bin Talhah. On their \narrival and entrance into the fold of Islam, the Prophet [pbuh] said, \"Quraish has \ngiven us its own blood",

    "content": "was Ashama bin Al-Abjar, received the \nProphet’s message, despatched by Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari, which At-Tabari \nreferred to, either late in the sixth year or early in the seventh year A.H. Deep \nscrutiny into the letter shows that it was not the one sent after Al-Hudaibiyah event. \nWording of the letter rather indicates that it was sent to that king when Ja‘far and his \ncompanions emigrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) during the Makkan period. One of its \nsentences read \"I have despatched my cousin, Ja‘far with a group of Muslims, to \nyou. Do be generous towards them and give up haughtiness.\" \nAl-Baihaqi, on the authority of Ibn Ishaq, gave the following narration of the \nProphet’s letter sent to Negus: \n\"This letter is sent from Muhammad, the Prophet to Negus Al-Ashama, the king of \nAbyssinia (Ethiopia). \nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance and believes in Allâh and His \nMessenger. I bear witness that there is no god but Allâh Alone with no associate, He \nhas taken neither a wife nor a son, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. \nI call you unto the fold of Islam; if you embrace Islam, you will find safety, \n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and \nChristians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we \nw orship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and \nthat none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn \naway, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’ \" [Al-Qur'an 3:64] \nShould you reject this invitation, then you will be held responsible for all the evils of \nthe Christians of your people.\" \nDr. Hameedullah (Paris), a reliable verifier, has adduced a version of the above letter \ndisclosed only a short time ago and identical to Ibn Al-Qaiyim’s narration. Dr. \nHameedullah exerted painstaking effort and used all means of modern technology to \nverify the text of the letter, which reads as follows: \n\n222\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Muhammad the Messenger of Allâh to Negus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia). \nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance. Salutations, I entertain Allâh’s praise, \nthere is no god but He, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Source of peace, the Giver of \npeace, the Guardian of faith, the Preserver of safety. I bear witness that Jesus, the \nson of Mary, is the spirit of Allâh and His Word which He cast into Mary, the virgin, \nthe good, the pure, so that she conceived Jesus. Allâh created him from His spirit \nand His breathing as He created Adam by His Hand. I call you to Allâh Alone with no \nassociate and to His obedience and to follow me and to believe in that which came to \nme, for I am the Messenger of Allâh. I invite you and your men to Allâh, the \nGlorious, the All-Mighty. I hereby bear witness that I have communicated my \nmessage and advice. I invite you to listen and accept my advice. Peace be upon him \nwho follows true guidance.\"[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/60] \nThe text of this letter is doubtlessly authentic, but to maintain that it was written \nafter Al-Hudaibiyah event is still a question lacking in definite evidence. \nWhen ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari communicated the Apostolic letter to Negus, the \nlatter took the parchment and placed it on his eye, descended to the floor, confessed \nhis faith in Islam and wrote the following reply to the Prophet [pbuh]: \n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Negus Ashama to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh. Peace be upon you, O \nMessenger of Allâh! and mercy and blessing from Allâh beside Whom there is no god. \nI have received your letter in which you have mentioned about Jesus and by the Lord \nof heaven and earth, Jesus is not more than what you say. We fully acknowledge \nthat with which you have been sent to us and we have entertained your cousin and \nhis companions. I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allâh, true and \nconfirming (those who have gone before you), I pledge to you through your cousin \nand surrender myself through him to the Lord of the worlds.\"[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/61] \nThe Prophet [pbuh] had asked Negus to send Ja‘far and his companions, the \nemigrants to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), back home. They came back to see the Prophet \n[pbuh] in Khaibar. Negus later died in Rajab 9 A.H. shortly after Tabuk Ghazwa. The \nProphet [pbuh] announced his death and observed prayer in absentia for him. \nAnother king succeeded Negus to the throne and another letter was sent to him by \nthe Prophet",
    "enhanced_text": "was Ashama bin Al-Abjar, received the \nProphet’s message, despatched by Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari, which At-Tabari \nreferred to, either late in the sixth year or early in the seventh year A.H. Deep \nscrutiny into the letter shows that it was not the one sent after Al-Hudaibiyah event. \nWording of the letter rather indicates that it was sent to that king when Ja‘far and his \ncompanions emigrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) during the Makkan period. One of its \nsentences read \"I have despatched my cousin, Ja‘far with a group of Muslims, to \nyou. Do be generous towards them and give up haughtiness.\" \nAl-Baihaqi, on the authority of Ibn Ishaq, gave the following narration of the \nProphet’s letter sent to Negus: \n\"This letter is sent from Muhammad, the Prophet to Negus Al-Ashama, the king of \nAbyssinia (Ethiopia). \nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance and believes in Allâh and His \nMessenger. I bear witness that there is no god but Allâh Alone with no associate, He \nhas taken neither a wife nor a son, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. \nI call you unto the fold of Islam; if you embrace Islam, you will find safety, \n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and \nChristians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we \nw orship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and \nthat none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn \naway, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’ \" [Al-Qur'an 3:64] \nShould you reject this invitation, then you will be held responsible for all the evils of \nthe Christians of your people.\" \nDr. Hameedullah (Paris), a reliable verifier, has adduced a version of the above letter \ndisclosed only a short time ago and identical to Ibn Al-Qaiyim’s narration. Dr. \nHameedullah exerted painstaking effort and used all means of modern technology to \nverify the text of the letter, which reads as follows: \n\n222\n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Muhammad the Messenger of Allâh to Negus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia). \nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance. Salutations, I entertain Allâh’s praise, \nthere is no god but He, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Source of peace, the Giver of \npeace, the Guardian of faith, the Preserver of safety. I bear witness that Jesus, the \nson of Mary, is the spirit of Allâh and His Word which He cast into Mary, the virgin, \nthe good, the pure, so that she conceived Jesus. Allâh created him from His spirit \nand His breathing as He created Adam by His Hand. I call you to Allâh Alone with no \nassociate and to His obedience and to follow me and to believe in that which came to \nme, for I am the Messenger of Allâh. I invite you and your men to Allâh, the \nGlorious, the All-Mighty. I hereby bear witness that I have communicated my \nmessage and advice. I invite you to listen and accept my advice. Peace be upon him \nwho follows true guidance.\"[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/60] \nThe text of this letter is doubtlessly authentic, but to maintain that it was written \nafter Al-Hudaibiyah event is still a question lacking in definite evidence. \nWhen ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari communicated the Apostolic letter to Negus, the \nlatter took the parchment and placed it on his eye, descended to the floor, confessed \nhis faith in Islam and wrote the following reply to the Prophet [pbuh]: \n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Negus Ashama to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh. Peace be upon you, O \nMessenger of Allâh! and mercy and blessing from Allâh beside Whom there is no god. \nI have received your letter in which you have mentioned about Jesus and by the Lord \nof heaven and earth, Jesus is not more than what you say. We fully acknowledge \nthat with which you have been sent to us and we have entertained your cousin and \nhis companions. I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allâh, true and \nconfirming (those who have gone before you), I pledge to you through your cousin \nand surrender myself through him to the Lord of the worlds.\"[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/61] \nThe Prophet [pbuh] had asked Negus to send Ja‘far and his companions, the \nemigrants to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), back home. They came back to see the Prophet \n[pbuh] in Khaibar. Negus later died in Rajab 9 A.H. shortly after Tabuk Ghazwa. The \nProphet [pbuh] announced his death and observed prayer in absentia for him. \nAnother king succeeded Negus to the throne and another letter was sent to him by \nthe Prophet",

He addressed \nEgypt’s vicegerent saying: \"There used to be someone before you who had arrogated \nthe status of the Supreme Lord, so Allâh punished him and made an example of him \nin the Hereafter, and in this life; therefore, take warning and never set a bad \nexample to others.\" Muqawqas answered: \"We are in no position to relinquish our \nreligion except for a better one.\" Hatib resumed: \"We invite you to embrace Islam, \nwhich will suffice you all what you may lose. Our Prophet has called people to profess \nthis Faith, Quraish and the Jews stood against him as bitter enemies, whereas \nChristians stood closest to his Call. Upon my life, Moses’s news about Christ is \nidentical to the latter’s good tidings about the advent of Muhammad; likewise, this \ninvitation of ours to you to embrace Islam is similar to your invitation to the people \nof Torah to accept the New Testament. Once a Prophet rises in a nation, he is eligible \nfor positive response, hence you are subject to the same Divine Law. Bear in mind \nthat we have not come to dissuade you from religion of Christ but rather bidding you \nto adhere to its tenets.\" Muqawqas meditated over the contents of the letter deeply \nand said: \"I have come to the conviction that this Prophet bids nothing abominable; \nhe is neither a straying magician nor a lying soothsayer.

I invite you to embrace Islam so that \nyou may live in security. If you come within the fold of Islam, Allâh will give you \ndouble reward, but in case you turn your back upon it, then the burden of the sins of \nall your people shall fall on your shoulders. \n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and \nChristians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we \nworship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and \n\n225\nthat none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn \naway, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’ \" [Al-Qur'an 3:64][Sahih Al-Bukhari \n1/4,5] \nThe Muslim envoy, Dihyah bin Khalifah Al-Kalbi, was ordered to hand the letter over \nto king of Busra, who would in turn, send it to Caesar. \nIncidentally, Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who by that time had not embraced Islam, was \nsummoned to the court and Hercules asked him many questions about Muhammad \n[pbuh] and the religion which he preached. The testimony which this avowed enemy \nof the Prophet gave regarding the personal excellence of the Prophet’s character and \nthe good that Islam was doing the human race, left Hercules wonder-struck. \nAl-Bukhâri, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, narrated that Hercules sent for Abu \nSufyan and his companions, who happened to be trading in Ash-Sham, Jerusalem. \nThat was during the truce that had been concluded between the polytheists of \nQuraish and the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. Hercules, seated amongst his chiefs of \nstaff, asked, \"Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a \nProphet?\" \"I (Abu Sufyan) replied: ‘I am the nearest relative to him from amongst \nthe group.’ So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind \nme. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). ‘Tell them (i.e. Abu \nSufyan’s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that \nmen who claims to be a Prophet. So if he tells a lie, they should contradict him \n(instantly)’. By Allâh had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a \nliar, I would have told lies\", Abu Sufyan later said. \nAbu Sufyan’s testimony went as follows: \"Muhammad descends from a noble family. \nNo one of his family happened to assume kingship. His followers are those deemed \nweak with numbers ever growing. He neither tells lies nor betrays others, we fight \nhim and he fights us but with alternate victory. He bids people to worship Allâh Alone \nwith no associate, and abandon our fathers’ beliefs. He orders us to observe prayer, \nhonesty, abstinence and maintain strong family ties.\" \"Hercules, on hearing this \ntestimony, turned to his translator bidding him to communicate to us his following \nimpression which reveals full conviction in the truthfulness of Muhammad’s \nProphethood: ‘I fully realize that Prophets come from noble families; he does not \naffect any previous example of Prophethood. Since none of his ancestors was a \nmonarch, we cannot then allege that he is a man trying to reclaim his father’s \nmonarchy. So long as he does not tell lies to people, he is for the more reason, \nimmune to telling lies as regards Allâh. Concerning his followers being those deemed \nweak with numbers ever growing, it is something that goes in agreement with \nquestions of Faith until this latter assumes its full dimensions geographically and \ndemographically. I have understood that no instance of apostasy has as yet \nappeared among his followers, and this points to the bliss of Faith that finds its \nabode in the human heart. Betrayal, as I see, is alien to him because real Prophets \nhold betrayal in abhorrence. Bidding worship of Allâh with no associates, observance \nof prayer, honesty and abstinence and prohibition of paganism are traits bound to \nsubject to him all my possessions. I have already known that a Prophet must arise \nbut it has never occurred to me that he will be an Arab from among you. If I was \nsure I would be faithful to him, I might hope to meet him, and if I were with him, I \nwould wash his feet.’ Hercules then requested that the Prophet’s letter be read. The \nobservations of the emperor and finally the definite and clear-cut exposition of the \nIslamic message could not but create a tense atmosphere amongst the clergy \npresent at the court. We were ordered to go out.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"While coming \n\n226\nout, I said to my companions, ‘The matter of Ibn Abi Kabshah (i.e. Muhammad \n[pbuh]) has become so prominent that even the king of Banu Al-Asfar (i.e. the \nRomans) is afraid of him.’ So I continued to believe that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] \nwould be victorious, till Allâh made me embrace Islam.\" The king did not embrace \nIslam — for it was differently ordained. However, the Muslim envoy was returned to \nMadinah with the felicitations of the emperor. \nOn his way back to Madinah, Dihyah Al-Kalbi was intercepted by people from Judham \ntribe in Hasmi, who looted the presents sent to the Prophet [pbuh]. Zaid bin Haritha \nat the head of five hundred men was despatched to that spot, inflicted heavy losses \non those people and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and a hundred \nwomen and boys.

    "content": "i to the governor of Bahrain, \ncarrying a letter inviting him to embrace Islam. In reply, Al-Mundhir bin Sawa wrote \nthe following letter: \n\"Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh]! I received your injunctions. Prior to this, I read your \nletter, which you wrote to the people of Bahrain extending to them an invitation to \nIslam. Islam appealed to some of them and they entered the fold of Islam, while \nothers did not find it appealing. In my country, there live Magians and Jews, and \ntherefore you may inform me of the treatment to be extended to them.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] wrote the following letter in reply to his: \n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Mundhir bin Sawa. \nPeace be on you! I praise Allâh with no associate, and I bear witness that \nMuhammad is His slave and Messenger. \nThereafter, I remind you of Allâh, the Mighty, the Glorious. Whoever accepts \nadmonition, does it for his own good. Whoever follows my messengers and acts in \naccordance with their guidance, he, in fact, accepts my advice. \nMy messengers have highly praised your behaviour. You shall continue in your \npresent office. Give the new Muslims full chance to preach their religion. I accept \nyour recommendation regarding the people of Bahrain, and I pardon the offences of \nthe offenders; therefore, you may also forgive them. \nOf the people of Bahrain whoever wants to go on in their Jewish or Magian faith, \nshould be made to pay Jizya (poll-tax).\"[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/61,62] \n\n227\n6. A Letter to Haudha bin ‘Ali, Governor of Yamama \n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Haudha bin ‘Ali. \nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall \nprevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command \nshall remain yours.\" \nThe envoy chosen was Sulait bin ‘Amr Al-‘Amiri, who after communicating his \nmessage, carried back the following reply to the Prophet [pbuh]: \n\"The Faith, to which you invite me, is very good. I am a famous orator and poet, the \nArabs highly respect me and I am of account among them. If you include me in your \ngovernment, I am prepared to follow you.\" \nThe governor then bestowed a reward on Sulait and presented him with clothes \nmade of Hajr fabric. Of course, he put all those presents in the trust of the Prophet \n[pbuh]. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] did not accept Haudha’s demand. He usually turned down such \nperemptory tone, and would say that the whole matter was in the Hand of Allâh, \nWho gave His land to whoever He desired. Gabriel later came with the Revelation \nthat Haudha had died. The Prophet [pbuh], in the context of his comment on this \nnews, said: \"Yamama is bound to give rise to a liar who will arrogate Prophethood to \nhimself but he will subsequently be killed.\" In reply to a question relating to the \nidentity of the killer, the Prophet said \"It is one of you, followers of Islam.\"[Za'd Al-Ma'ad \n3/63] \n7. A Letter to Harith bin Abi Shamir Al-Ghassani, King of Damascus \n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Al-Harith bin Abi Shamir. \nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance, believes in it and regards it as true. I \ninvite you to believe in Allâh Alone with no associate, thenceafter your kingdom will \nremain yours.\" \nShuja‘ bin Wahab had the honour of taking the letter to Harith, who upon hearing \nthe letter read in his audience, was madly infuriated and uttered: \"Who dares to \ndisposs me of my country, I’ll fight him (the Prophet),\" and arrogantly rejected the \nProphet’s invitation to the fold of Islam.[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/62; Muhadarat Tareekh Al-Umam Al-Islamiyah \n1/146] \n8. A Letter to the King of ‘Oman, Jaifer, and his Brother ‘Abd Al-Jalandi \n\"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \nFrom Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah to Jaifer and ‘Abd Al-Jalandi. \n\n228\nPeace be upon him who follows true guidance; thereafter I invite both of you to the \nCall of Islam. Embrace Islam. Allâh has sent me as a Prophet to all His creatures in \norder that I may instil fear of Allâh in the hearts of His disobedient creatures so that \nthere may be left no excuse for those who deny Allâh. If you two accept Islam, you \nwill remain in command of your country; but if you refuse my Call, you’ve got to \nremember that all your possessions are perishable. My horsemen will appropriate \nyour land, and my Prophethood will assume preponderance over your kingship.\" \n‘Amr bin Al-’As, who was chosen to carry the letter, narrated the following story that \nhappened before he was admitted into the audience of Jaifer. \n\"When I arrived in ‘Oman I contacted ‘Abd, who was known to be more mild-\ntempered than his brother: \n‘Amr: I am the messenger of Allâh’s Prophet coming to see both, you and your \nbrother. \n‘Abd: You have to see my brother and read to him the letter you are carrying. He is \nmy senior in both age and kingship. Incidentally, what is the purport of your \nmission? \n‘Amr: The Prophet calls upon you to believe in Allâh Alone with no associate, discard \nany other deities and testify to the slavehood and Messengership of Muhammad. \n‘Abd: O ‘Amr! You come from a noble family, but first of all, tell me what was your \nfather’s attitude concerning this Faith? You know, we used to follow his steps. \n‘Amr: Death overtook him before believing in Muhammad’s mission; I wish now he \nhad embraced Islam and been truthful to it before his death. I myself had adopted \nthe same attitude until Allâh guided me towards Islam. \n‘Abd: When did you embrace Islam? \n‘Amr: When I was at Negus’s court. By the way, the latter did also enter into the fold \nof Islam. \n‘Abd: What was his people’s reaction? \n‘Amr: They approved of him and followed his steps. \n‘Abd: The bishops and monks? \n‘Amr: They did the same. \n‘Abd: Beware ‘Amr of lying for this soon betrays man. \n‘Amr: I never tell lies; moreover, our religion never allows it. \n‘Abd: Has Hercules been informed of the Islamization of Negus? \n\n229\n‘Amr: Yes, of course. \n‘Abd: How did you happen to know that? \n‘Amr: Negus used to pay land tax to Hercules, but when the former embraced Islam, \nhe swore he would discontinue that tax. When this news reached Hercules, his \ncourtiers urged him to take action against Negus but he refused and added that he \nhimself would do the same if he were not sparing of his kingship. \n‘Abd: What does your Prophet exhort you to do? \n‘Amr: He exhorts us to obey Allâh, the All-Mighty, the All-Glorious, be pious and \nmaintain good ties with family kin; he forbids disobedience, aggression, adultery, \nwine, idolatry and devotion to the cross. \n‘Abd: Fair words and fair beliefs are those you are calling for. I wish my brother \nwould follow me to believe in Muhammad [pbuh] and profess his religion, but my \nbrother is too sparing of his kingship to become a subordinate. \n‘Amr: Should your brother surrender himself to Islam, the Prophet would give him \nauthority over his people and take alms tax from the wealthy people to be given to \nthe needy. \n‘Abd: That is fair behaviour. But what is this alms tax you have mentioned? \n‘Amr: It is a Divine injunction that alms tax be taken from the well-to-do people who \nhave surplus wealth and be distributed to the poor. \n‘Abd: I doubt if this can work among our people. \n‘Amr stayed for some days to be admitted into Jaifer’s court until he was finally \ngranted this permit. \"He asked me to hand him the letter to read it. After that he \nasked me how Quraish reacted and I answered that they had followed him, some out \nof their own freewill and others overpowered by military fighting. Now, people have \nchosen Islam in preference to other creeds, and have realized through their mental \ninsight that they had been straying in darkness. None, except you, is now out of the \ndomain of Islam, so I advise you to embrace Islam so that you can provide security \nto yourself and your country.\" \nHere, he asked me to call on him the following day. The following day he showed \nsome reluctance in receiving me but his brother, ‘Abd, interceded and I was given \nthe chance to see him again but this time to address me in a threatening arrogant \ntone. However, after a private talk with his brother and reconsidering the whole \nsituation, both brothers embraced Islam and proved to be true to Islam that had \nbegun to make its way into this new area. \nThe context of this story reveals that this letter was sent at a much later date than \nthe others, most lik",

According to the majority of scholars, this \nincident took place three days before the battle of Khaibar. \nIt has been narrated on the authority of Salamah bin Al-Akwa‘, the hero of this \nbattle, that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sent his hireling Rabah, with his camels to \na nearby pasture. I, taking Talhah’s horse, went there for the same purpose. When \nthe day dawned, ‘Abdur Rahman Al-Fazari made a raid, drove away all the camels, \nand killed the man who looked after them. I told Rabah to ride the horse, take it to \nTalhah and inform the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] that the polytheists had made \naway with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Madinah, \nshouted thrice: \"Come to our help!\" After that I set out in pursuit of the raiders, \nshooting at them with arrows and chanting (self-eulogatory) verse: \nI am the son of Al-Akwa‘ \nToday is the day of defeat for the mean. \nBy Allâh, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a \nhorseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree (hid myself) sitting at its base, \nshoot at him and hamstring his horse. At last they entered a narrow mountain gorge. \nI ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued \nto chase them in this way until I got all the camels released with no one left with \nthem. They fled in all directions and I following and shooting at them continually \nuntil they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances, lightening their \nburden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with a stone so that the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] and his Companions might recognize them (that it was \nbooty left by the enemy). They went on until they came to a narrow valley. They sat \ndown to eat something, and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Four of them \nascended the mountain coming towards me. When they were near enough to hear \nme, I shouted: \"Do you recognize me?\" They said: \"No. Who are you?\" I said: \"I am \nSalamah son of Al-Akwa‘. I can kill anyone of you I like but none of you can kill me.\" \nSo they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], who came riding through the trees. The foremost among \nthem was Akhram, behind him was Abu Qatadah Al-Ansari followed by Al-Miqdad bin \nAl-Aswad. Akhram and ‘Abdur Rahman Al-Fazari met in combat. Akhram hamstrung \n‘Abdur Rahman’s horse but the latter managed to strike him with his lance and kill \nhim. ‘Abdur Rahman turned around riding Akhram’s horse. Abu Qatadah, seeing this, \ngot engaged in fierce combat with ‘Abdur Rahman, smote him with his lance and it \nwas fatal. The polytheists consequently fled away and I was in their pursuit until \nbefore sunset they reached a valley with a spring of water called Dhu Qarad. They \nrested there to have a drink. I however, running in hot pursuit, turned them out of \nthe valley before they could drink a drop of water. Later on, the Prophet [pbuh], \nalong with his Companions, overtook me. I addressed him saying: Messenger of \nAllâh, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the \nmarauders and finish them. In reply, the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Ibn Al-Akwa‘, you \nhave taken enough and so now you have to show magnanimity; now they have \nreached the habitation of Ghatfan where they are being feted.\" He added saying: \n\n232\n\"Our best horseman today is Abu Qatadah, and our best footman today is Salamah.\" \nHe allotted me two shares of the booty - the share meant for the horseman and the \nother meant for the footman, and combined both of them for me.

After Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty, the major party of the anti-Islam \ntripartite coalition — Quraish, the bedouin horde of Najd tribes and the Jews — was \nneutralized, therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] deemed it an appropriate time to settle \nhis affairs with the other two wings — the Jews and the Najd tribes — in order that \npeace and security could prevail and the Muslims may devote their time and effort in \npropagating the Message of Allâh and calling people to embrace it. Khaibar itself had \nalways remained a hotbed of intrigue and conspiracy, and the Jews had always \nconstituted it a source of military provocations and war instigation centre, so it was \ngiven a top priority on the agenda of the Prophet’s compelling exigencies. The Jews \nof Khaibar had united by an ancient alliance with the Confederates, triggered Bani \nQuraiza to practise treachery, maintained contacts with Ghatfan and the Arabians \nand they even devised an attempt at the Prophet’s life. In fact, the continual \nafflictions that the Muslims had sustained were primarily attributable to the Jews. \nEnvoys were repeatedly sent to them for peaceful settlement, but all in vain. \nConsequently the Prophet [pbuh] came to the conclusion that a military campaign \nwas a must in order to forestall their hostilities. \nInterpreters of the Noble Qur’ân suggest that capturing Khaibar had been a Divine \npromise implied in Allâh’s Words: \n\"Allâh has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture, and He has \nhastened for you this.\" [Al-Qur'an 48:20] \ni.e., Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty and the surrender of Khaibar. \nThe hypocrites and people weak of heart had hung back from joining the true \nMuslims in Al-Hudaibiyah campaigns, so now Allâh, the All-Mighty inculcated the \nfollowing words in His Prophet’s ears: \n\"Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils, \n‘Allow us to follow you.’ They want to change Allâh’s Words. Say: ‘You shall \nnot follow us; thus Allâh has said beforehand.’ Then they will say: ‘Nay, you \nenvy us.’ Nay, but they understand not except a little.\" [Al-Qur'an 48:15] \nFor this reason, the Prophet [pbuh] invited only those who were willing to fight in the \ncause of Allâh to accompany him in his march against Khaibar. 1400 men only, who \nhad sworn allegiance in response to his call. \nMeanwhile, Siba‘ bin ‘Arfatah Al-Ghifari was chosen to run the affairs of Madinah. \nAnother incident of high significance is noteworthy, namely the Islamization of Abu \nHuraira, a venerable Muslim scholar and an authentic narrator of the Prophetic \ntraditions. \nThe hypocrites of Arabia took notice of the fresh Islamic intentions so they began to \nalert the Jews to the imminent military activities. Their chief, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai \n\n234\ndelegated an envoy to the Jews of Khaibar warning them against the dangers \napproaching, and nerving them to resist the Muslims as they outnumbered the latter \nand were better equipped. On hearing the news the Jews despatched Kinanah bin Abi \nAl-Huqaiq and Haudha bin Qais to their former allies, the tribe of Ghatfan requesting \nmilitary assistance, promising to grant them half the yield of the fruit that their \nfarms could yield if they managed to beat the Muslims. \nThe Prophet marched by way of Isra Mountain and then went forward with the army \ntill he halted in a valley called Ar-Raji‘, encamping between Khaibar and Ghatfan so \nas to prevent the latter from reinforcing the Jews. The guides accompanying him led \nhim to an intersection from which branched out three roads with different \ndesignations; all leading to his destination. He abstained from following the first two \nroads on grounds of their ominous d",

In fact, the continual \nafflictions that the Muslims had sustained were primarily attributable to the Jews. \nEnvoys were repeatedly sent to them for peaceful settlement, but all in vain. \nConsequently the Prophet [pbuh] came to the conclusion that a military campaign \nwas a must in order to forestall their hostilities. \nInterpreters of the Noble Qur’ân suggest that capturing Khaibar had been a Divine \npromise implied in Allâh’s Words: \n\"Allâh has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture, and He has \nhastened for you this.\" [Al-Qur'an 48:20] \ni.e., Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty and the surrender of Khaibar. \nThe hypocrites and people weak of heart had hung back from joining the true \nMuslims in Al-Hudaibiyah campaigns, so now Allâh, the All-Mighty inculcated the \nfollowing words in His Prophet’s ears: \n\"Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils, \n‘Allow us to follow you.’ They want to change Allâh’s Words. Say: ‘You shall \nnot follow us; thus Allâh has said beforehand.’ Then they will say: ‘Nay, you \nenvy us.’ Nay, but they understand not except a little.\" [Al-Qur'an 48:15] \nFor this reason, the Prophet [pbuh] invited only those who were willing to fight in the \ncause of Allâh to accompany him in his march against Khaibar. 1400 men only, who \nhad sworn allegiance in response to his call. \nMeanwhile, Siba‘ bin ‘Arfatah Al-Ghifari was chosen to run the affairs of Madinah. \nAnother incident of high significance is noteworthy, namely the Islamization of Abu \nHuraira, a venerable Muslim scholar and an authentic narrator of the Prophetic \ntraditions. \nThe hypocrites of Arabia took notice of the fresh Islamic intentions so they began to \nalert the Jews to the imminent military activities. Their chief, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai \n\n234\ndelegated an envoy to the Jews of Khaibar warning them against the dangers \napproaching, and nerving them to resist the Muslims as they outnumbered the latter \nand were better equipped. On hearing the news the Jews despatched Kinanah bin Abi \nAl-Huqaiq and Haudha bin Qais to their former allies, the tribe of Ghatfan requesting \nmilitary assistance, promising to grant them half the yield of the fruit that their \nfarms could yield if they managed to beat the Muslims. \nThe Prophet marched by way of Isra Mountain and then went forward with the army \ntill he halted in a valley called Ar-Raji‘, encamping between Khaibar and Ghatfan so \nas to prevent the latter from reinforcing the Jews. The guides accompanying him led \nhim to an intersection from which branched out three roads with different \ndesignations; all leading to his destination. He abstained from following the first two \nroads on grounds of their ominous d",

It has been narrated on the authority of Salamah bin Al-Akwa‘, who said: We \nmarched upon Khaibar with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. We journeyed \nduring the night. One of the men said to my brother ‘Amir: Won’t you recite \nto us some of your verses, ‘Amir? So he began to chant his verses to urge the \ncamels, reciting: \n O Allâh, if You had not guided us, \n We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity, nor offered prayers. \n We wish to lay down our lives for You; so forgive You our lapses, \n And keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies). \n Bestow upon us peace and tranquility, \n Behold, when with a cry they called upon us to help \n2. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"Who is this driver (of the camels)?\" \nThey said: \"It is ‘Amir.\" He said: \"Allâh will show mercy to him.\" A man said: \n\"Martyrdom is reserved for him; O Messenger of Allâh, would that you had \nallowed us to benefit ourselves from his life.\"[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/603; Sahih Muslim \n2/115] The Prophet’s Companions had already known that he would never \ninvoke Allâh’s mercy upon a close Companion but to single him out for \nmartyrdom.[Sahih Muslim 2/115] \n3. On their way down a valley, the Muslims began to entertain Allâh’s \nGreatness: shouting at the top of their voices: \"Allâh is Great, Allâh is Great, \nthere is no god but Allâh.\" The Prophet [pbuh] asked them to lower down \ntheir voices saying: \"The One you are invoking is neither absent nor deaf; He \nis close to you, All-hearing.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/605]\" \n4. In a spot called As-Sahba’, not far from Khaibar, the Prophet [pbuh] \nobserved the afternoon prayer, then he called his Companions to have \nwhatever food provisions they had. What they brought was too scanty to \nsatisfy them all. The Prophet took it by his hand and it immediately grew in \nquantity, so they all ate to their fill. Shortly afterward, he and the others, \nrinsed their mouths and performed the evening prayer without ablution [Sahih \nAl-Bukhari 2/603]; he did the same for the night prayer [Maghazi Al-Waqidi \np.112]. \n\n235\nThe following morning, at sunrise, the Muslims encountered the Jews when they had \ncome out about their jobs with their axes, spades and strings driving their cattle \nalong. They began to shout in surprise: \"Muhammad has come along with his force!\" \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"Allâh is Great, Khaibar shall face destruction. \nBehold! When we descend in the city centre, it will be a bad day for those who have \nbeen warned (but have not taken heed). [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/603, 604]\" \nFor encampment, the Prophet [pbuh] had chosen a certain plot of land he deemed \nsuitable to serve as the headquarters of his army. However, a veteran fighter of his \ncalled Hubab bin Al-Mundhir suggested that they, under the exigencies of war \nrequirements and for the sake of providing maximum logistic facilities, shift to \nanother place. On approaching the vicinity of Khaibar, the Prophet ordered his troops \nto halt, and began to invoke his Lord saying: \"O Allâh! Lord of the seven heavens \nand what they harbour beneath, Lord of the seven earths and what lies in their \nwombs, Lord of devils and whomsoever they have led astray; we beseech You to \ngrant us the good of this village (Khaibar), the good of its inhabitants and the good \nthat lies in it. We seek refuge with You from the evil of this village, the evil of its \ninhabitants, and the evil that lies in it.\" Then he ordered, \"Now march (towards the \nvillage) in the Name of Allâh.\" [Ibn Hisham 2/329] \n\"The banner\", the Prophet [pbuh] declared \"would be entrusted to a man who loves \nAllâh and His Messenger and they (Allâh and His Messenger) love him.\" All the \nMuslims came forward in the following morning hoping to be granted the honour of \ncarrying the banner. The Prophet [pbuh] called for ‘Ali bin Abi Talib whose eyes used \nto hurt, and handed it to him. ‘Ali, on his part, pledged he would fight the enemies \nuntil they embraced Islam. The Prophet [pbuh] answered him saying: \"Take things \neasy and invite them to accept Islam and brief them on their duties towards Allâh. I \nswear by Allâh that if only one should be guided through your example, that would \nsurely outweigh the best of our camels.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/505, 60",

The first fort he was to attack was Na‘im, the first defence line with a \nformidable strategic position. Marhab, the leader of the fort, invited ‘Amr bin Al-\nAkwa‘ to meet him in combat and the latter responded; when ‘Amr struck the Jew, \nhis sword recoiled and wounded his knee, and he died of that wound. The Prophet \n[pbuh] later said: \"For him (‘Amir) there is a double reward in the Hereafter.\" He \nindicated this by putting two of his fingers together. ‘Ali bin Abi Talib then undertook \nto meet Marhab in combat, and managed to kill him. Yasir, Marhab’s brother, then \nturned up challenging the Muslims to a fight. Az-Zubair was equal to it and killed him \non the spot. Real fighting then broke out and lasted for a few days. The Jews showed \ncourage and proved to be too formidable even to the repeated rushes of the veteran \nsoldiers of Islam. However, they later realized the futility of resistance and began to \nabandon their positions in An-Na‘im and infiltrate into the fortress of As-Sa‘b. \nAl-Hubab bin Al-Mundhir Al-Ansari led the attack on As-Sa‘b fortress and laid siege to \nit for three days after which the Muslims stormed it with a lot of booty, provisions \n\n236\nand food to fall to their lot therein. This victory came in the wake of the Prophet’s \n[pbuh] invocation to Allâh to help Banu Aslam in their relentless and daring attempts \nto capture that fort. \nDuring the process of the war operations, extreme hunger struck the Muslims. They \nlit fires, slaughtered domestic asses and began to cook them. When the Prophet \n[pbuh] inquired about the fires and cooking, he ordered that they throw away the \nmeat and wash the cooking pots, forbidding the practice of eating such meat. \nThe Jews, meanwhile, evacuated An-Natat and barricaded themselves in Az-Zubair \nfort, a formidable defensive position inaccessible to both cavalry and infantry. The \nMuslims besieged it for three days, but in vain. A Jew spy told the Prophet about a \nsubterranean water source that provided them with water, and advised that it be cut \noff in order to undermine their resistance. The Prophet [pbuh] did that so the Jews \ngot out to engage with the Muslims in fierce fighting during which some Muslims and \nten Jews were killed, but the fort was eventually conquered. \nShortly after this battle, the Jews moved to ’Abi Castle and barricaded themselves \ninside.

    "content": "econd Part of Khaibar conquered \nWhen the Prophet [pbuh], along with his army, moved to this part of Khaibar, Al-\nKatiba, he laid a heavy siege to it for fourteen days with the Jews barricading \nthemselves inside their forts. When he was about to use the rams, the Jews realized \nthat they would perish, therefore, they asked for a negotiable peace treaty. \nThere is one controversial point in this context. Was this part of Khaibar (with its \nthree forts) conquered by force? Ibn Ishaq clearly stated that Al-Qamus fort was \nconquered by force. Al-Waqidi, on the other hand, maintained that the three forts \nwere taken through peace negotiations, and force, if any, was resorted to only to \nhand the fort over to the Muslims; the two other forts surrendered without fighting. \n\n237\n \nNegotiations \nIbn Abi Al-Huqaiq was despatched to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to negotiate the \nsurrender treaty. The Prophet [pbuh] agreed to spare their lives on condition they \nevacuate Khaibar and the adjacent land, leaving whatever gold and silver they had in \ntheir possession. However, he stipulated that he would disavow any commitment if \nthey concealed anything. Shortly afterwards, the forts were handed over to the \nMuslims and all Khaibar was reduced and brought under the sway of Islam. \nThis treaty notwithstanding, Abi Al-Huqaiq’s two sons concealed a leather bag full of \njewels, and money belonging to Huyai bin Al-Akhtab, who carried it with him when \nBanu Nadir had been banished. Kinanah bin Ar-Rabi‘, who had hidden the musk \nsomewhere, was obdurate in his denial and so he was killed when the musk was \ndiscovered and his dishonesty was proven. Abi Al-Huqaiq’s two sons were killed in \nrecompense for breaching the covenant, and Safiyah, Huyai’s daughter was taken as \na captive. \nDistribution of Spoils \nIn accordance with the agreement already concluded, the Jews would be obliged to \nevacuate Khaibar, but they were anxious to keep on cultivating the rich soil and fine \norchard for which Khaibar was famous. They, therefore, approached the Prophet \n[pbuh] with the request that they be allowed to cultivate their lands and they would \ngive half of the produce to the Muslims. Muhammad [pbuh] was kind enough to \naccede to their request. \nThe Messenger [pbuh] divided the land of Khaibar into two: one half to provide the \nfood to be stored in case of any accidental calamity that might befall the Muslims, \nand for entertaining the foreign delegates who started to frequent Madinah a lot; the \nother half would go to the Muslims who had witnessed Al-Hudaibiyah event whether \npresent or absent. The total number of shares came to 36, of which 18 were given to \nthe people above-mentioned. The army consisted of 1400 men of whom were 200 \nhorsemen. The horseman was allotted 3 shares and the footman one. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/137, \n138] \nThe spoils taken at Khaibar were so great that Ibn ‘Umar said: \"We never ate our fill \nuntil we had conquered Khaibar.\" ‘Aishah [R] is narrated to have said: \"Now we can \neat our fill of dates.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/609] \nOn their return to Madinah, the Emigrants were able to return to the Helpers of \nMadinah all the gifts they had received. All of this affluence came after the conquest \nof Khaibar and the great economic benefits that the Muslims began to reap. [Za'd Al-\nMa'ad 2/148; Sahih Muslim 2/96] \nThe conquest of Khaibar coincided with the arrival of the Prophet’s cousin Ja‘far bin \nAbi Talib and his companions along with Abi Musa Al-Ash‘ari and some Muslims from \nAbyssinia (Ethiopia). \nAbu Musa Al-Ash‘ari narrated that he and over fifty companions, while in Yemen, \ntook a ship which landed them in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and they happened to meet \nthere Ja‘far and his companions. He said, \"We stayed together until the Prophet \n[pbuh] sent an envoy asking us to come back. When we returned, we found out \n\n238\nthat he had already conquered Khaibar, yet he gave us our due shares of the spoils.\" \nThe advent of those men came at the request made by the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] to Negus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), through a Prophetic deputy, ‘Amr bin \nOmaiya Ad-Damari. Negus sent them back, 16 men altogether with their wives and \nchildren on two boats. The rest of emigrants had arrived in Madinah earlier. \n[Muhadarat Tareekh Al-Umam Al-Islamiyah 1/128] \nIn the same context, Safiyah, whose husband Kinanah bin Abi Al-Huqaiq was killed \nfor treachery, was taken as a captive and brought along with other prisoners of war. \nAfter the permission of the Prophet [pbuh] was sought, Dihyah Al-Kalbi chose one of \nthem and she happened to be Safiyah. The other Muslims, however, advised that \nSafiyah, being the daughter of the chief of Bani Quraiza and Bani Nadir, should be \nmarried to the Prophet [pbuh], who agreed to their opinion, invited her to Islam, \nfreed and took her as wife on her embracing Islam. The wedding feast consisted of \ndates and fat, and was held on his way back to Madinah at a spot called Sadd As-\nSahba’. \nAfter the conquest of Khaibar, a Jewish woman called Zainab bint Al-Harith offered \nthe Prophet [pbuh] a roasted sheep she had poisoned. He took a mouthful, but it \nwas not to his liking so he spat it out. After investigation, the woman confessed that \nshe had stuffed the food with poison alleging that if the eater were a king, she would \nthen rid herself of him, but should he be a Prophet, then he would be bound to learn \nabout it.

Allâh cast fear into the hearts of the \npeople of Fadak, a village standing to the north of Khaibar, and they hastened to ask \nfor peace, and be allowed to leave in safety, and give up their wealth in return for \nthat. The Prophet [pbuh] entered into an agreement with them similar to the \nprevious one with the people of Khaibar. Fadak was exclusively the Prophet’s \nbecause neither Muslim cavalry nor camelry were involved in fight thereby. \nNo sooner had the Prophet [pbuh] discharged the affair of Khaibar than he started a \nfresh move towards Wadi Al-Qura, another Jewish colony in Arabia. He mobilized his \nforces and divided them into three regiments with four banners entrusted to Sa‘d bin \n‘Ubada, Al-Hubab bin Mundhir, ‘Abbad bin Bishr and Sahl bin Haneef. Prior to \nfighting, he invited the Jews to embrace Islam but all his words and exhortations fell \non deaf ears. Eleven of the Jews were killed one after another and with each one \nnewly killed, a fresh call was extended inviting those people to profess the new faith. \nFighting went on ceaselessly for approximately two days and resulted in full \nsurrender of the Jews. Their land was conquered, and a lot of booty fell in the hands \nof the Muslims. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] stayed in Wadi Al-Qura for four days, distributed the booty \namong the Muslim fighters and reached an agreement with the Jews similar to that \nof Khaibar. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/146, 147] \nThe Jews of Taima’, hearing beforehand about the successive victories of the Muslim \narmy and the defeats that their brethren, the Jews, had sustained, showed no \n\n239\nresistance when the Prophet [pbuh] reached their habitation. On the contrary, they \ntook the initiative and offered to sign a reconciliation treaty to the effect that they \nreceive protection but pay tribute in return. Having achieved his objective and \nsubdued the Jews completely, the Prophet [pbuh] made his way back home and \narrived in Madinah in late Safar or early Rabi‘ Al-Awwal 7 A.H. \nIt is noteworthy that the Prophet [ pbuh], being the best amongst war experts, \nrealized quite readily that evacuating Madinah after the lapse of the prohibited \nmonths (Muharram, Dhul Qa‘da and Dhul Hijja) would not be wise at all with the \npresence of the desert bedouins roaming in its vicinity.

    "content": "Having subdued two powerful sides of the Confederates coalition, the Prophet [pbuh] \nstarted preparations to discipline the third party, i.e. the desert bedouins, who took \nNajd for habitation, and continued in their usual practices of looting and plundering. \nUnlike the Jews of Khaibar and people of Makkah, they had a liking for living in the \nwilderness dispersed in scattered spots, hence the difficulty of bringing them under \ncontrol, and the futility of carrying out deterrent campaigns against them. However, \nthe Prophet [pbuh] was determined to put an end to this unacceptable situation and \ncalled the Muslims around him to get ready to launch a decisive campaign against \nthose harassing rebels. Meanwhile it was reported to him that Bani Muharib and \nBanu Tha‘lbah of the Ghatfan tribe were gathering army in order to encounter the \nMuslims. The Prophet [pbuh] proceeded towards Najd at the head of 400 or 700 \nmen, after he had mandated Abu Dhar - in another version, ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan - to \ndispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. The Muslim fighters penetrated \ndeep into their land until they reached a spot called Nakhlah where they came across \nsome bedouins of Ghatfan, but no fighting took place because the latter had agreed \nto go into reconciliation with the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] led his followers that \nday in a prayer of fear. \nAl-Bukhari, on the authority of Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari, narrated that they set out on an \nexpedition with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. \"We were six in number and had \n(with us) only one camel which we rode turn by turn. Our feet were injured. My feet \nwere so badly injured that my nails came off. We, therefore, bandaged our feet with \nrags, so this expedition was called Dhat-ur-Riqa‘ (i.e. the expedition of rags.)\" [Sahih Al-\nBukhari 2/592; Sahih Muslim 2/118] \nJabir narrated: In the course of Dhat-ur-Riqa‘ expedition, we came to a leafy tree \nwhere the Prophet [pbuh] sat shading himself off the burning sun. The others \ndispersed here and there seeking shelter from heat. The Prophet [pbuh] had a short \nnap after he had hung his sword on the tree. A polytheist, meanwhile came, seized \nthe sword and unsheathed it. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] woke up to find his sword drawn in the man’s hand. The bedouin \nhere asked the Prophet (unarmed then): \"Who would hold me back from killing you \nnow?\" The Prophet [pbuh] then answered: \"It is Allâh.\" In another version, it was \nreported that the Prophet [pbuh] took the sword when it had fallen down and the \nman said: \"You (the Prophet) are the best one to hold a sword.\" The Prophet [pbuh] \nasked the man if he would testify to the Oneness of Allâh and the Messengership of \nMuhammad. The Arabian answered that he would never engage in a fight against \nhim, nor would he ally people fighting the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] set the man \nfree and let him go to his people to say to them that he had seen the best one \namong all people. [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.264; Fath Al-Bari 7/416] \nA woman from the Arabians was taken prisoner in the context of this battle. Her \nhusband, on hearing the news, swore he would never stop until he had shed the \nblood of a Muslim.

    "content": "t the expedition of Dhat-ur-Riqa‘ had a tremendous impact on all the \nArabians. It cast fear into their hearts and rendered them too powerless to \nantagonize the Muslim society in Madinah. They began to acquiesce in the prevailing \nsituation and resigned themselves to new geo-political conditions working in favour \nof the new religion. Some of them even embraced Islam and took an active part in \nthe conquest of Makkah and the battle of Hunain, and received their due shares of \nthe war booty. \nFrom that time onward, the anti-Islam tripartite coalition had been subdued, and \npeace and security prevailed. The Muslims, then started to redress any political \nimbalance and fill in the small gaps that still triggered unrest here and there in the \nface of the great drive of Islamization that enveloped the whole area. We could in \nthis context mention some of these incidental skirmishes which pointed markedly to \nthe ever-growing power of the Muslim society. \n1. A platoon headed by Ghalib bin ‘Abdullah Al-Laithi in Safar or in Rabi‘ Al-\nAwwal 7 A.H. was despatched to muffle the provocative behaviour of Bani Al-\nMuluh. The Muslims managed to kill a large number of the enemy soldiers and \ncaptured a great deal of booty. A large army of polytheists rushed in their \nheel but floods hindered the pursuit, and the Muslims managed to withdraw in \nsafety. \n2. ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, at the head of a 30-soldier group, set out to a spot \ncalled Turbah in Sha‘ban 7 A.H. to discipline the people of Hawazin. He no \nlonger arrived at their habitation that they fled for their lives. \n3. Thirty men with Basheer bin Sa‘d Al-Ansari headed for Bani Murrah in Sha‘ban \n7 A.H. in Fadak area. He killed a large number of the enemy and seized a lot \nof their camels and cattle. On his way back, the enemy gathered up forces \nand overtook the Muslims at night. They showered Basheer and his men with \narrows, and killed all the Muslims except Basheer, who took refuge in Fadak \nand stayed with the Jews there until his wounds healed. \n4. Ghalib bin ‘Abdullah Al-Laithi at the head of a platoon of 130 men launched an \nattack against Bani ‘Awâl and Bani ‘Abd bin Tha‘lbah in Ramadan 7 A.H. They \nkilled some of the enemy’s men and captured their cattle and camels. ‘Usama \nbin Zaid killed Mardas bin Nahik, a polytheist, but after he had pronounced \nthe testimony of Allâh’s Oneness to which incident the Prophet [pbuh] \ncommented addressing his Companions: \"Would you rip open his heart to \ndiscern whether he is truthful or a liar?\" \n5. A thirty-horseman group headed by ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha marched towards \nKhaibar on reports that Aseer (or Basheer bin Razam) was rallying the ranks \nof Bani Ghatfan to attack the Muslims: They managed to persuade that Jew to \nfollow them to Madinah encouraging him that the Prophet [pbuh] would \ninstitute him as a ruler of Khaibar. On their way back there occurred a sort of \nmisunderstanding that gave rise to fierce fighting between the two parties \nresulting in the death of Aseer and the thirty men with him. \n6. In Shawwal 7 A.H., Basheer bin Sa‘d Al-Ansari marched towards Yemen and \nJabar at the head of 300 Muslim fighters to subdue a large mob of polytheists \n\n242\nwho gathered to raid the outskirts of Madinah. Basheer and his men used to \nmarch at night and lurk during the day until they reached their destination. \nHaving heard about the advent of the Muslims, the polytheists fled away \nleaving behind them a large booty and two men who later embraced Islam on \narrival in Madinah. \n7. In the year 7 A.H., shortly before the Compensatory ‘Umrah (lesser \npilgrimage), a man called Jashm bin Mu‘awiyah came to a spot called Ghabah \nwhere he wanted to gather the people of Qais and entice them into fighting \nthe Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh], on hearing these reports, despatched Abu \nHadrad with two men to see to the situation. Abu Hadrad, through a clever \nstrategy, managed to rout the enemy and capture a lot of their cattle. [Za'd Al-\nMa'ad 2/149, 150; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/229, 230; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.322-324] \n\n243\nThe Compensatory ‘Umrah \n(Lesser Pilgrimage) \nWhen Dhul Qa‘da month approached towards the close of the seventh year A.H., the \nProphet [pbuh] ordered his people, and the men who witnessed Al-Hudaibiyah Truce \nTreaty in particular, to make preparations to perform ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). He \nproceeded with 2000 men besides some women and children [Fath Al-Bari 7/700], \nand 60 camels for sacrifice, to visit the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah. The Muslims took \ntheir weapons with them fearing the treachery of the Quraishites, but left them with \na party of two hundred men at a place some eight miles from Makkah. They entered \nthe city with the swords in their scabbards [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/151; Fath Al-Bari \n7/700], with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head on his she-camel, Al-Qaswa’, while the \nsurrounding Companions attentively focusing their look on him, all saying: \"Here I \nam! at Your service O Allâh!\" The Quraishites had left the place and retired to their \ntents on the adjoining hills. The Muslims performed the usual circumambulation \nvigorously and briskly; and on recommendation by the Prophet [pbuh] they did their \nbest to appear strong and steadfast in their circumambulation as the polytheists had \nspread rumours that they were weak because the fever of Yathrib (Madinah) had \nsapped their strength. They were ordered to run in the first three rounds and then \nwalk in the remaining ones. The Makkans meanwhile aligned on the top of Qu‘aiqa‘an \nMount watching the Muslims, tongue-tied at witnessing their strength and devotion. \nWhen they entered the Holy Sanctuary, ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha walked before the \nProphet [pbuh] reciting: \n\"Get out of his way, you disbelievers, make way, we will fight you about its \nrevelation with strokes that will remove heads from shoulders and make friend \nunmindful of friend.\" \nAfter ritual walking and running between the two hills of Makkah, Safa and Marwah, \nthe Prophet[pbuh] with the Muslims halted at the latter spot to slaughter the \nsacrificial animals and shave their heads. \nThe main body of the pilgrims had now performed the basic rites of the lesser \npilgrimage, but there remained those who were entrusted the charge of the \nweapons. The Prophet had these relieved, and they went through the same \ndevotions as the others did. \nOn the morning of the fourth day of the pilgrimage, the notables of Quraish asked \n‘Ali bin Abi Talib to tell the Prophet [pbuh] to leave Makkah along with his \nCompanions. He, of course, could not conceive of violating the terms of Al-\nHudaibiyah Treaty, therefore he ordered his men to depart for a village called Sarif \nwhere he stayed for some time. \nIt was during this visit of the Prophet [pbuh] to Makkah for pilgrimage that his uncle \n‘Abbas offered the hand of his sister-in-law, Maimuna — the daughter of Harith, to \nhim. The Prophet [pbuh] was kind enough to accept this offer since it was an \neffective step towards cementing the ties of relationship between the Prophet [pbuh] \nand the influential men of Makkah. The wedding took place in Sarif. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/152] \n\n244\nNarrators attached different designations to this lesser pilgrimage. Some called it the \ncompensatory lesser pilgrimage, performed instead of that uncompleted of \nHudaibiyah; and the other one, given preponderance by jurists, is the lesser \npilgrimage consequent on certain terms of a treaty already agreed upon. \nOn the whole, compensatory, judicial consent, retribution and reconciliation are all \nterms applicable to that visit. \nSome military operations, directed against some still obdurate desert Arabians, took \nplace at the conclusion of the lesser pilgrimage, of which we could mention: \n1. A platoon of 50 men led by Ibn Abi Al-‘Awja’ was despatched by the Prophet \n[pbuh] to the habitations of Bani Saleem inviting them to embrace Islam, but \nall the words fell on deaf ears. Fierce fighting erupted between both parties \nduring which the Muslim leader was wounded, and two of the enemy were \ncaptured. \n2. Ghalib bin ‘Abdullah at the head of 200 men was despatched to Fadak where \nthey killed some rebels and a lot of booty fell to their lot. \n3. Banu Quda‘a had gathered a large number of men to raid the Muslim \npositions. On hearing the news, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched Ka‘b bin \n‘Umair Al-Ansari at the head of 15 men to deal with this situation. They \nencountered the army, and called them to enter into the fold of Islam but the \nrebels gave a negative response and showered the Muslims with arrows killing \nall of them except one who was carried back home later seriously wounded. \n[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/231] \nThere was also an insignificant skirmish that occurred in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal 8 A.H.

    "content": "The Compensatory ‘Umrah\n(Lesser Pilgrimage)\nWhen Dhul Qa‘da month approached towards the close of the seventh year A.H., the \nProphet [pbuh] ordered his people, and the men who witnessed Al-Hudaibiyah Truce \nTreaty in particular, to make preparations to perform ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). He \nproceeded with 2000 men besides some women and children [Fath Al-Bari 7/700], \nand 60 camels for sacrifice, to visit the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah. The Muslims took \ntheir weapons with them fearing the treachery of the Quraishites, but left them with \na party of two hundred men at a place some eight miles from Makkah. They entered \nthe city with the swords in their scabbards [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/151; Fath Al-Bari \n7/700], with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head on his she-camel, Al-Qaswa’, while the \nsurrounding Companions attentively focusing their look on him, all saying: \"Here I \nam! at Your service O Allâh!\" The Quraishites had left the place and retired to their \ntents on the adjoining hills. The Muslims performed the usual circumambulation \nvigorously and briskly; and on recommendation by the Prophet [pbuh] they did their \nbest to appear strong and steadfast in their circumambulation as the polytheists had \nspread rumours that they were weak because the fever of Yathrib (Madinah) had \nsapped their strength. They were ordered to run in the first three rounds and then \nwalk in the remaining ones. The Makkans meanwhile aligned on the top of Qu‘aiqa‘an \nMount watching the Muslims, tongue-tied at witnessing their strength and devotion. \nWhen they entered the Holy Sanctuary, ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha walked before the \nProphet [pbuh] reciting: \n\"Get out of his way, you disbelievers, make way, we will fight you about its \nrevelation with strokes that will remove heads from shoulders and make friend \nunmindful of friend.\" \nAfter ritual walking and running between the two hills of Makkah, Safa and Marwah, \nthe Prophet[pbuh] with the Muslims halted at the latter spot to slaughter the \nsacrificial animals and shave their heads. \nThe main body of the pilgrims had now performed the basic rites of the lesser \npilgrimage, but there remained those who were entrusted the charge of the \nweapons. The Prophet had these relieved, and they went through the same \ndevotions as the others did. \nOn the morning of the fourth day of the pilgrimage, the notables of Quraish asked \n‘Ali bin Abi Talib to tell the Prophet [pbuh] to leave Makkah along with his \nCompanions. He, of course, could not conceive of violating the terms of Al-\nHudaibiyah Treaty, therefore he ordered his men to depart for a village called Sarif \nwhere he stayed for some time. \nIt was during this visit of the Prophet [pbuh] to Makkah for pilgrimage that his uncle \n‘Abbas offered the hand of his sister-in-law, Maimuna — the daughter of Harith, to \nhim. The Prophet [pbuh] was kind enough to accept this offer since it was an \neffective step towards cementing the ties of relationship between the Prophet [pbuh] \nand the influential men of Makkah. The wedding took place in Sarif. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/152] \n\n244\nNarrators attached different designations to this lesser pilgrimage. Some called it the \ncompensatory lesser pilgrimage, performed instead of that uncompleted of \nHudaibiyah; and the other one, given preponderance by jurists, is the lesser \npilgrimage consequent on certain terms of a treaty already agreed upon. \nOn the whole, compensatory, judicial consent, retribution and reconciliation are all \nterms applicable to that visit. \nSome military operations, directed against some still obdurate desert Arabians, took \nplace at the conclusion of the lesser pilgrimage, of which we could mention: \n1. A platoon of 50 men led by Ibn Abi Al-‘Awja’ was despatched by the Prophet \n[pbuh] to the habitations of Bani Saleem inviting them to embrace Islam, but \nall the words fell on deaf ears. Fierce fighting erupted between both parties \nduring which the Muslim leader was wounded, and two of the enemy were \ncaptured. \n2. Ghalib bin ‘Abdullah at the head of 200 men was despatched to Fadak where \nthey killed some rebels and a lot of booty fell to their lot. \n3. Banu Quda‘a had gathered a large number of men to raid the Muslim \npositions. On hearing the news, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched Ka‘b bin \n‘Umair Al-Ansari at the head of 15 men to deal with this situation. They \nencountered the army, and called them to enter into the fold of Islam but the \nrebels gave a negative response and showered the Muslims with arrows killing \nall of them except one who was carried back home later seriously wounded. \n[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/231] \nThere was also an insignificant skirmish that occurred in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal 8 A.H. Shuja‘ \nbin Wahab Al-Asadi, along with 25 men, marched towards Bani Hawazin tribe where \nthey encountered no resistance but managed to gain some booty.

    "content": "245\nThe Battle of Mu’tah \nIt was the most significant and the fiercest battle during the lifetime of the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], a preliminary and a prelude to the great conquests of the \nland of the Christians. It took place in Jumada Al-Ula 8 A.H. / September 629 A.D. \nMu’tah is a village that lies on the borders of geographical Syria. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] had sent Al-Harith bin ‘Umair Al-Azdi on an errand to carry a \nletter to the ruler of Busra. On his way, he was intercepted by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr \nAl-Ghassani, the governor of Al-Balqa’ and a close ally to Caesar, the Byzantine \nEmperor. Al-Harith was tied and beheaded by Al-Ghassani. \nKilling envoys and messengers used to be regarded as the most awful crime, and \namounted to the degree of war declaration. The Prophet [pbuh] was shocked on \nhearing the news and ordered that a large army of 3000 men be mobilized and \ndespatched to the north to discipline the transgressors. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/155; Fath \nAl-Bari 7/511] It was the largest Muslim army never mobilized on this scale except in \nthe process of the Confederates Battle. \nZaid bin Haritha was appointed to lead the army. Ja‘far bin Abi Talib would replace \nhim if he was killed, and ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha would succeed Ja‘far in case the latter \nfell.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/611] A white banner was raised and handed over to Zaid. [Mukhtasar Seerat \nAr-Rasool p.327] \nThe Prophet [pbuh] recommended that they reach the scene of Al-Harith’s murder \nand invite the people to profess Islam. Should the latter respond positively, then no \nwar would ensue, otherwise fighting them would be the only alternative left. \nHe ordered them: \n\"Fight the disbelievers in the Name of Allâh, neither breach a covenant nor \nentertain treachery, and under no circumstances a new-born, woman, an \nageing man or a hermit should be killed; moreover neither trees should be \ncut down nor homes demolished. [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.327; Rahmat-\nul-lil'alameen 2/271]\" \nAt the conclusion of the military preparations, the people of Madinah gathered and \nbade the army farewell. ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha began to weep at that moment, and \nwhen asked why he was weeping, he swore that it was not love for this world nor \nunder a motive of infatuation with the glamour of life but rather the Words of Allâh \nspeaking of Fire that he heard the Prophet [pbuh] reciting: \n\"There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a \nDecree which must be accomplished.\" [Al-Qur'an 19:71] \nThe Muslim army then marched northward to Ma‘ân, a town bordering on \ngeographical Syria. There news came to the effect that Heraclius had mobilized a \nhundred thousand troops together with another hundred thousand men of Lakham, \nJudham and Balqain — Arabian tribes allied to the Byzantines. The Muslims, on their \npart had never thought of encountering such a huge army. They were at a loss about \nwhat course to follow, and spent two nights debating these unfavourable conditions. \n\n246\nSome suggested that they should write a letter to the Prophet [pbuh] seeking his \nadvice. ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha was opposed to them being reluctant and addressed \nthe Muslims saying: \"I swear by Allâh that this very object which you hold in \nabhorrence is the very one you have set out seeking, martyrdom. In our fight we \ndon’t count on number of soldiers or equipment but rather on the Faith that Allâh has \nhonoured us with. Dart to win either of the two, victory or martyrdom.\" In the light \nof these words, they moved to engage with the enemy in Masharif, a town of Al-\nBalqa’, and then changed direction towards Mu’tah where they encamped. The right \nflank was led by Qutba bin Qatadah Al-‘Udhari, and the left by ‘Ubadah bin Malik Al-\nAnsari. Bitter fighting started between the two parties, three thousand Muslims \nagainst an enemy fiftyfold as large. \nZaid bin Haritha, the closest to the Messenger’s heart, assumed leadership and \nbegan to fight tenaciously and in matchless spirit of bravery until he fell, fatally \nstabbed. Ja‘far bin Abi Talib then took the banner and did a miraculous job. In the \nthick of the battle, he dismounted, hamstrung his horse and resumed fighting until \nhis right hand was cut off. He seized the banner with his left hand until this too was \ngone. He then clasped the banner with both arms until a Byzantine soldier struck and \ncut him into two parts. he was posthumously called \"the flying Ja‘far\" or \"Ja‘far with \ntwo wings\" because Allâh has awarded him two wings to fly wherever he desired \nthere in the eternal Garden. Al-Bukhari reported fifty stabs in his body, none of them \nin the back. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/611] \n‘Abdullah bin Rawaha then proceeded to hold up the banner and fight bravely on his \nhorseback while reciting enthusiastic verses until he too was killed. Thereupon a \nman, from Bani ‘Ajlan, called Thabit bin Al-Arqam took the banner and called upon \nthe Muslims to choose a leader. The honour was unanimously granted to Khalid bin \nAl-Waleed, a skilled brave fighter and an outstanding strategist. It was reported by \nAl-Bukhari that he used nine swords that broke while he was relentlessly and \ncourageously fighting the enemies of Islam. He, however, realizing the grave \nsituation the Muslims were in, began to follow a different course of encounter, \nrevealing the super strategy-maker, that Khalid was rightly called. He reshuffled the \nright and left flanks of the Muslim army and introduced forward a division from the \nrear in order to cast fear into the hearts of the Byzantine by deluding them that fresh \nreinforcements had arrived. The Muslims engaged with the enemies in sporadic \nskirmishes but gradually and judiciously retreating in a fully organized and well-\nplanned withdrawal. \nThe Byzantines, seeing this new strategy, believed that they were being entrapped \nand drawn in the heart of the desert. They stopped the pursuit, and consequently the \nMuslims managed to retreat back to Madinah with the slightest losses. [Fath-Al-Bari 7/513, \n514; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/156] \nThe Muslims sustained twelve martyrs, whereas the number of casualties among the \nByzantines was unknown although the details of the battle point clearly to a large \nnumber. Even though the battle did not satisfy the Muslims’ objective, namely \navenging Al-Harith’s murder, it resulted in a far-ranging impact and attached to the \nMuslims a great reputation in the battlefields. The Byzantine Empire, at that time, \nwas a power to be reckoned with, and mere thinking of antagonizing it used to mean \nself-annihilation, let alone a three-thousand-soldier army going into fight against \n200,000 soldiers far better equipped and lavishly furnished with all luxurious \nconveniences. The battle was a real miracle proving that the Muslims were \nsomething exceptional not then familiar. Moreover, it gave evidence that Allâh \n\n247\nbacked them and their Prophet, Muhammad, was really Allâh’s Messenger. In the \nlight",

    "content": "249\nThe Conquest of Makkah \nIbn Al-Qaiyim described the conquest of Makkah as the greatest one by which Allâh \nhonoured His religion, Messenger, soldiers and honest party. He thereby rescued the \nSacred House, whose guidance all people seek. It was the greatest propitious event \nin heaven and on earth. It was the most significant prelude to a new era that was to \nwitness the great march of Islamization and the entry of people into the fold of Islam \nin huge hosts. It provided an ever shining face and a most glowing source of \ninspiration to the whole earth. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/160] \nPre-Conquest Events \nAccording to the terms of the treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Arab tribes were given the \noption to join either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraish, with which they desired \nto enter into treaty alliance. Should any of these tribes suffer aggression, then the \nparty to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu \nBakr joined Quraish, and Khuza‘ah joined the Prophet [pbuh]. They thus lived in \npeace for sometime but ulterior motives stretching back to pre-Islamic period ignited \nby unabated fire of revenge triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without caring a \nbit for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza‘ah in a place called Al-\nWateer in Sha‘ban, 8 A.H. Quraish helped Banu Bakr with men and arms taking \nadvantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah \nsought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary \nto all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chasing them in the \nsanctified area — where no blood should be shed — massacred his adversaries. \nWhen the aggrieved party sought justice from their Muslim allies, the Prophet \n[pbuh], as their leader, demanded an immediate redress for not only violating the \ntreaty but also slaying men allied to him in the sanctified area. Three demands were \nmade, the acceptance of any one of them was imperative: \na. to pay blood money for the victims of Khuza‘ah, \nb. to terminate their alliance with Banu Bakr; or \nc. to consider the truce to have been nullified. \nThis behaviour on the part of Quraish was clearly a breach of the treaty of Al-\nHudaibiyah and was obviously an act of hostility against the allies of the Muslims, i.e. \nBanu Khuza‘ah. Quraish immediately realized the grave situation and feared the \nhorrible consequences looming on the horizon. They immediately called for an \nemergency meeting and decided to delegate their chief Abu Sufyan to Madinah for a \nrenewal of the truce. He directly headed for the house of his daughter Umm Habiba \n(the Prophet’s wife). But as he went to sit on the Messenger’s carpet, she folded it \nup. \"My daughter,\" said he, \"I hardly knew if you think the carpet is too good for me \nor that I am too good for the carpet.\" She replied, \"It is the Messenger of Allâh’s \ncarpet, and you are an unclean polytheist.\" \nBeing disgusted at the curt reply of his daughter, Abu Sufyan stepped out of her \nroom and went to see the Prophet [pbuh], but the latter was well aware of his tricks \nand did not hold him any assurance. He then approached Abu Bakr, but the latter too \ndeclined to interfere. He contacted ‘Umar to intercede but this great Companion \nmade a point-blank refusal. At last he saw ‘Ali bin Abi Talib and began begging him \n\n250\nin the most humble words, cunningly alluding to the prospects of mastery over all \nthe Arabs if he were to intercede for the renewal of the treaty. ‘Ali also briefly \nregretted his inability to do anything for him. \nAbu Sufyan turned his steps back to Makkah in a state of bitter disappointment and \nutter horror. There he submitted a report of his meeting with his daughter, Abu Bakr, \n‘Umar and ‘Ali’s reaction and the meaningful silence of the Prophet. The Makkans \nwere dismayed, but did not expect imminent danger. \nPreparations for the Attack on Makkah, and the Prophet’s Attempt at imposing a \nNews Black-out \nOn the authority of At-Tabari, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] asked ‘Aishah [R], his \nspouse three days prior to receiving news relating to breaching of covenant, to make \npreparations peculiar to marching out for war. Abu Bakr, meanwhile, came in and \nasked ‘Aishah [R] what the matter was, showing surprise at the preparations being \nmade as it was not, as he said, the usual time for war. She replied that she had no \nidea. On the morning of the third day ‘Amr bin Sâlim Al-Khuza‘i arrived in the \ncompany of forty horsemen to brief the Prophet [pbuh] on the plight of his people \nand seeking the Muslims’ help for retaliation. People of Madinah then got to know \nthat Quraish had breached the covenant. Budail followed ‘Amr, and then Abu Sufyan \nand the news was unequivocally confirmed. \nWith view of securing a complete news black-out concerning his military intentions, \nthe Prophet [pbuh] despatched an eight-men platoon under the leadership of \nQatadah bin Rab‘i in the direction of Edam, a short distance from Madinah, in \nRamadan 8 A.H., in order to divert the attention of people and screen off the main \ntarget with which he was preoccupied. \nThere was so much dread and fear everywhere that Hatib, one of the most trusted \nfollowers of the Prophet [pbuh] secretly despatched a female messenger with a letter \nto Makkah containing intimation of the intended attack. The Prophet [pbuh] received \nnews from the heaven of Hatib’s action and sent ‘Ali and Al-Miqdad with instructions \nto go after her. They overtook the messenger, and after a long search discovered the \nletter carefully hidden in her locks. The Prophet [pbuh] summoned Hatib and asked \nhim what had induced him to this act. He replied, \"O Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]! I \nhave no affinity of blood with Quraish; there is only a kind of friendly relationship \nbetween them and myself. My family is at Makkah and there is no one to look after it \nor to offer protection to it. My position stands in striking contrast to that of the \nrefugees whose families are secure due to their blood ties with Quraish. I felt that \nsince I am not related to them, I should, for the safety of my children, earn their \ngratitude by doing good to them. I swear by Allâh that I have not done this act as an \napostate, forsaking Islam. I was prompted only by the considerations I have just \nexplained.\" \n‘Umar wanted to cut his head off as a hypocrite, but the Prophet [pbuh] accepted his \nexcuse and granted him pardon, then addressed ‘Umar saying: \"Hatib is one of those \nwho fought in the battle of Badr. How do you know that he is a hypocrite? Allâh is \nlikely to look favourably on those who participated in that battle. Turning then, to \nHatib, he said: \"Do as you please, for I have forgiven you.\" \n\n251\nAfter making full preparation, the Prophet [pbuh] proceeded to Makkah at the head \nof ten thousand soldiers on the 10th of Ramadan, 8 A.H. He mandated Abu Ruhm Al-\nGhifari to dispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. When they reached Al-\nJuhfa, Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib and his family came to join the Prophet [pbuh]. \nAt Al-Abwa’, the Muslims came across Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith and ‘Abdullah bin \nOmaiyah, the Prophet’s cousins, but, on account of the harm they had inflicted, and \ntheir satiric language, on the believers, they were not welcomed. ‘Ali addressed Abu \nSufyan to go and beseech the Prophet [pbuh] for pardon and confess his ill-\nbehaviour in a manner similar to that of Yusuf’s (the Prophet Joseph) brothers: \n\"They said: ‘By Allâh! Indeed Allâh has preferred you above us, and we \ncertainly have been sinners.’\" [Al-Qur'an 12:91] \nAbu Sufyan observed ‘Ali’s counsel, to which the Prophet quoted Allâh’s Words: \n\"He said: ‘No reproach on you this day, may Allâh forgive you, and He is the \nMost Merciful of those who show mercy!’\" [Al-Qur'an 12:92] \nAbu",

The Prophet [pbuh] received \nnews from the heaven of Hatib’s action and sent ‘Ali and Al-Miqdad with instructions \nto go after her. They overtook the messenger, and after a long search discovered the \nletter carefully hidden in her locks. The Prophet [pbuh] summoned Hatib and asked \nhim what had induced him to this act. He replied, \"O Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]! I \nhave no affinity of blood with Quraish; there is only a kind of friendly relationship \nbetween them and myself. My family is at Makkah and there is no one to look after it \nor to offer protection to it. My position stands in striking contrast to that of the \nrefugees whose families are secure due to their blood ties with Quraish. I felt that \nsince I am not related to them, I should, for the safety of my children, earn their \ngratitude by doing good to them. I swear by Allâh that I have not done this act as an \napostate, forsaking Islam. I was prompted only by the considerations I have just \nexplained.\" \n‘Umar wanted to cut his head off as a hypocrite, but the Prophet [pbuh] accepted his \nexcuse and granted him pardon, then addressed ‘Umar saying: \"Hatib is one of those \nwho fought in the battle of Badr. How do you know that he is a hypocrite? Allâh is \nlikely to look favourably on those who participated in that battle. Turning then, to \nHatib, he said: \"Do as you please, for I have forgiven you.\" \n\n251\nAfter making full preparation, the Prophet [pbuh] proceeded to Makkah at the head \nof ten thousand soldiers on the 10th of Ramadan, 8 A.H. He mandated Abu Ruhm Al-\nGhifari to dispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. When they reached Al-\nJuhfa, Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib and his family came to join the Prophet [pbuh]. \nAt Al-Abwa’, the Muslims came across Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith and ‘Abdullah bin \nOmaiyah, the Prophet’s cousins, but, on account of the harm they had inflicted, and \ntheir satiric language, on the believers, they were not welcomed. ‘Ali addressed Abu \nSufyan to go and beseech the Prophet [pbuh] for pardon and confess his ill-\nbehaviour in a manner similar to that of Yusuf’s (the Prophet Joseph) brothers: \n\"They said: ‘By Allâh! Indeed Allâh has preferred you above us, and we \ncertainly have been sinners.’\" [Al-Qur'an 12:91] \nAbu Sufyan observed ‘Ali’s counsel, to which the Prophet quoted Allâh’s Words: \n\"He said: ‘No reproach on you this day, may Allâh forgive you, and He is the \nMost Merciful of those who show mercy!’\" [Al-Qur'an 12:92] \nAbu",

    "content": "Muslims then marched on in a state of fasting until they reached a place called \nAl-Qadeed where water was available. There they broke fast [Sahih Al-Bukhari \n2/613] and resumed their movement towards Mar Az-Zahran. The Quraishites were \nquite unaware of the development of affairs, but the Prophet [pbuh] did not like to \ntake them by surprise. He, therefore, ordered his men to kindle fire on all sides for \ncooking purposes. The idea behind this was that Quraish should be afforded full \nopportunity to assess the situation in which they were pitchforked correctly, and \nshould not endanger their lives by leaping blindly in the battlefield. ‘Umar bin Al-\nKhattab was entrusted with the guard duty. In the meanwhile, Abu Sufyan along \nwith Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqua’, two terrible polytheists, went out to \nreconnoiter. Before they got near the camp, they met ‘Abbas, the Prophet’s uncle. \nHe apprised Abu Sufyan of the situation and advised him to accept Islam and \npersuade his people to surrender before Muhammad [pbuh]; otherwise, his head \nwould be struck off. \nUnder the prevailing compelling circumstances, Abu Sufyan went in the company of \n‘Abbas seeking the Prophet’s [pbuh] audience. The Muslims were furious to see Abu \nSufyan and wanted to kill him on the spot. But the two men managed, not without \ndifficulties, to see the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who advised that they see him the \nfollowing day. The Prophet [pbuh] addressed Abu Sufyan saying: \"Woe to you! Isn’t \nit time for you to bear witness to the Oneness of Allâh and Prophethood of \nMuhammad?\" Here, the archenemy of Islam began to beseech the Prophet [pbuh] in \nthe most earnest words that testify to the Prophet’s generosity and mild temper \nbegging for pardon and forgiveness, and professing wholeheartedly the new faith. \nOn request by ‘Abbas, the Prophet [pbuh], in the context of the general amnesty he \nproclaimed, gave Abu Sufyan, who had a liking for bragging, a special privilege, \nsaying: \"He who takes refuge in Abu Sufyan’s house is safe; whosoever confines \nhimself to his house, the inmates thereof shall be in safety, and he who enters the \nSacred Mosque is safe.\" \n\n252\nOn the morning of Tuesday, 17th. Ramadan, 8 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] left Mar Az-\nZahran. He ordered Al-‘Abbas to detain Abu Sufyan at a commanding gorge that \ncould afford a full view of the Muslim army parading on its way towards Makkah, and \nhence give him the chance to see the great and powerful soldiers of Allâh. The \ndifferent tribes successively passed with their banners flown up, until at last the \nbattalion of the Emigrants and Helpers with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head heavily \narmed marched by. Abu Sufyan began to wonder who those people were, to which \nAl-‘Abbas told him that they were Muhammad [pbuh] and his Companions. Abu \nSufyan said that no army however powerful could resist those people and addressing \nAl-‘Abbas, he said: \"I swear by Allâh that the sovereignty of your brother’s son has \nbecome too powerful to withstand.\" Al-‘Abbas answered, \"It is rather the power of \nProphethood,\" to which the former agreed. \nSa‘d bin ‘Ubadah carried the flag of the Helpers. When he passed by Abu Sufyan, he \nsaid \"Today will witness the great fight, you cannot seek sanctuary at Al-Ka‘bah. \nToday will witness the humiliation of Quraish.\" Abu Sufyan complained about this to \nthe Prophet [pbuh] who got angry and said \"Nay, today Al-Ka‘bah will be sanctified, \nand Quraish honoured,\" and quickly ordered that Sa‘d should be stripped off the flag, \nand that it should be entrusted to his son Qais, in another version, to Az-Zubair. \nAl-‘Abbas urged Abu Sufyan to hasten into Makkah and warn the Quraishites against \nany aggressive behaviour towards the Muslims. There in Makkah, he shouted at the \ntop of his voice and warned against any hostilities advising them to seek safety in his \nhouse. His wife got indignant and tugged at his moustache cursing him and abusing \nhis cowardly stance. The people within Makkah mocked Abu Sufyan and dispersed in \ndifferent directions, some into their houses, others into the Holy Sanctuary while \nsome undisciplined reckless ruffians led by ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin \nOmaiyah and Suhail bin ‘Amr encamped themselves in a place called Khandamah, \nwith a murderous intent in their minds. \nThe Prophet [pbuh], on his part, was quite modestly and calmly drawing the final \ntouches for the military breakthrough awaiting the Muslims, by Allâh’s Will. He \nappointed Khalid bin Al-Waleed as a leader of the right flank of the army with Aslam, \nSulaim, Ghifar, Muzainah and Juhainah tribes under his command to enter Makkah \nthrough its lower avenues. Az-Zubair bin ‘Awwam was to lead the left flank and \nwould storm Makkah from the upper side holding up the Messenger’s banner. Abu \n‘Ubaidah took command of the infantry and was to penetrate into the city via a side \nvalley. They were given full and decisive orders not to kill unless in self defence and \nin that case they would exterminate any aggressive elements and quell any \nopposition. \nThe Muslim battalions marched out each in its already drawn route to fulfill the \nmissions they were supposed to carry out. Khalid bin Al-Waleed worked his way into \nthe heart of the town quite successively killing twelve of the ruffians and sustaining \ntwo martyrs. Az-Zubair set out and reached the fixed destination where he planted \nthe banner at Al-Fath (conquest) Mosque and waited there for the arrival of the \nProphet [pbuh]. A tent was pitched for him where he offered prayers of thanks to the \nAll-Mighty Allâh, Who, out of His immense grace, had granted him a splendid victory. \nBut he did not repose long. He, in the company of the Helpers and Emigrants, got up \nand proceeded towards Al-Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, which is an emblem of the \nOneness and Supremacy of Allâh. It was unfortunately infested with idols that \n\n253\nnumbered 360. He knocked them down with his bow while reciting the verse of the \nNoble Qur’ân: \n\"And Say: ‘Truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism or this Qur’ân or Jihâd against \npolytheists) has come and Batil (falsehood, i.e. Satan or polytheism, etc.) \nhas vanished. Surely! Batil is ever bound to vanish.’\" [Al-Qur'an 17:81] \nAnd Allâh further said: \n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): \"The Truth (the Qur’ân and Allah’s \nInspiration) has come, and Al-Batil (falsehood - Iblis) can neither create \nanything nor resurrect (any thing).\" [Al-Qur'an 34:49] \nHe then started the usual circumambulation on his ride. He was not in a state of \nIhram (ritual consecration) then. On completion, he called for ‘Uthman bin Talhah, \nthe janitor of Al-Ka‘bah, from whom he took the key. He went in and saw images of \nProphets Ibrahim and Ishmael, [AWS], throwing divination arrows. He denounced \nthese acts of Quraish and ordered that all idols be dismantled, images and effigies \ndeleted. He then entered the sacred hall to face the wall opposite the door and there \nagain performed devout prostrations, and went around acclaiming Allâh’s Greatness \nand Oneness. Shortly afterwards, he returned to the door-way and standing upon its \nelevated step, gazed in thankfulness on the thronging multitude below and delivered \nthe following celebrated address: \n\"There is no god but Allâh Alone. He has no associates. He made good His Promise \nthat He held to His slave and helped him and defeated all the Confederates along. \nBear in mind that every claim of privilege, whether that of blood, or property, is \nunder my heel, except that of the custody of Al-Ka‘bah and supplying of water to the \npilgrims. Bear in mind that for anyone who is slain, even though semi-deliberately, \nwith club or whip, for him the blood-money is very severe: a hundred camels, forty \nof them to be pregnant. \n\"O people of Quraish! surely Allâh has abolished from you all pride of the \npre-Islamic era and all conceit in your ancestry, (because) all men are \ndescended from Adam, and Adam was made out of clay.\" \nHe then recited to them the verse: \n\"O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you \ninto nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most \nhonourable of you near Allâh is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. one \nof the Muttaqûn: i.e. pious and righteous persons who fear Allâh much \n(abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden), and \nlove Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)]. \nVerily, Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Aware.\" [Al-Qur'an 49:13] \nHe further added: \n\"O you people of Quraish! What do you think of the treatment that I am \nabout to accord to you?\" \n\n254\nThey replied: \n\"O noble brother and son of noble brother! We expect nothing but goodness \nfrom you.\" \nUpon this he said: \n\"I speak to you in the same words as Yusuf (the Prophet Joseph) spoke \nunto his brothers: He said: \"No reproach on you this day,\" [Al-Qur'an 12:92] \ngo your way, for you are freed ones.\" \nAs for the door-keeping of Al-Ka‘bah and supplying of water to pilgrims, the Prophet \n[pbuh] ordered that these jobs remain in the hand of ‘Uthman bin Talhah and that \nthe key will stay with him and his descendants for ever. \nWhen time for prayer approached, Bilal ascended Al-Ka‘bah and called for prayer. \nAbu Sufyan bin Harb, ‘Itab bin Usaid and Al-Harith bin Hisham were meanwhile \nsitting in the yard. ‘Itab bin Usaid commented on the new situation (Bilal ascending \nAl-Ka‘bah and calling for prayer) saying that Allâh honoured Usaid (his father) having \nnot heard such words. The Prophet [pbuh] approached and assisted by Divine \nRevelation told them that he had learnt about what they had spoken of. Al-Harith \nand ‘Itab, taken by incredible surprise, immediately professed Islam and bore \nwitness to the Messengership of Muhammad [pbuh] adding that \"We swear by Allâh \nthat none had been with us to inform you.\" \nOn that very day, the Prophet [pbuh] entered ‘Umm Hani’s house where he washed \nand offered prayers of victory. ‘Umm Hani had sheltered two Makkan relatives of \nhers in her house in which act she was granted support by the Prophet [pbuh]. \nShedding blood of nine arch-criminals was declared lawful even under the curtains of \nAl-Ka‘bah. Nevertheless, only four of them were killed while the others were \npardoned for different reasons. As for those who were killed, mention could be made \nof ‘Abdul ‘Uzza bin Khatal who had become a Muslim and then deputed to collect \nalms-tax in the company of a Helper. They had also a slave with them. ‘Abdullah, in \na fit of rage, killed the Helper’s slave on account of a mere trifling dispute, and \njoined the pagan Arabs as an apostate. He was never repentant at this heinous crime \nbut rather employed two women singers and incited them to sing satirically about \nthe Prophet [pbuh]. \nThe other man who was put to death was Miqyas bin Sababa. He was a Muslim. A \nHelper accidently killed his brother Hisham. The Prophet [pbuh] had arranged the \npayment of blood money to him, which he had accepted. His revengeful nature, \nhowever, was never appeased, so he killed the Helper and went to Makkah as an \napostate. \nSimilarly, Huw",

Isn’t \nit time for you to bear witness to the Oneness of Allâh and Prophethood of \nMuhammad?\" Here, the archenemy of Islam began to beseech the Prophet [pbuh] in \nthe most earnest words that testify to the Prophet’s generosity and mild temper \nbegging for pardon and forgiveness, and professing wholeheartedly the new faith. \nOn request by ‘Abbas, the Prophet [pbuh], in the context of the general amnesty he \nproclaimed, gave Abu Sufyan, who had a liking for bragging, a special privilege, \nsaying: \"He who takes refuge in Abu Sufyan’s house is safe; whosoever confines \nhimself to his house, the inmates thereof shall be in safety, and he who enters the \nSacred Mosque is safe.\" \n\n252\nOn the morning of Tuesday, 17th. Ramadan, 8 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] left Mar Az-\nZahran. He ordered Al-‘Abbas to detain Abu Sufyan at a commanding gorge that \ncould afford a full view of the Muslim army parading on its way towards Makkah, and \nhence give him the chance to see the great and powerful soldiers of Allâh. The \ndifferent tribes successively passed with their banners flown up, until at last the \nbattalion of the Emigrants and Helpers with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head heavily \narmed marched by. Abu Sufyan began to wonder who those people were, to which \nAl-‘Abbas told him that they were Muhammad [pbuh] and his Companions. Abu \nSufyan said that no army however powerful could resist those people and addressing \nAl-‘Abbas, he said: \"I swear by Allâh that the sovereignty of your brother’s son has \nbecome too powerful to withstand.\" Al-‘Abbas answered, \"It is rather the power of \nProphethood,\" to which the former agreed. \nSa‘d bin ‘Ubadah carried the flag of the Helpers. When he passed by Abu Sufyan, he \nsaid \"Today will witness the great fight, you cannot seek sanctuary at Al-Ka‘bah. \nToday will witness the humiliation of Quraish.\" Abu Sufyan complained about this to \nthe Prophet [pbuh] who got angry and said \"Nay, today Al-Ka‘bah will be sanctified, \nand Quraish honoured,\" and quickly ordered that Sa‘d should be stripped off the flag, \nand that it should be entrusted to his son Qais, in another version, to Az-Zubair. \nAl-‘Abbas urged Abu Sufyan to hasten into Makkah and warn the Quraishites against \nany aggressive behaviour towards the Muslims. There in Makkah, he shouted at the \ntop of his voice and warned against any hostilities advising them to seek safety in his \nhouse. His wife got indignant and tugged at his moustache cursing him and abusing \nhis cowardly stance. The people within Makkah mocked Abu Sufyan and dispersed in \ndifferent directions, some into their houses, others into the Holy Sanctuary while \nsome undisciplined reckless ruffians led by ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin \nOmaiyah and Suhail bin ‘Amr encamped themselves in a place called Khandamah, \nwith a murderous intent in their minds. \nThe Prophet [pbuh], on his part, was quite modestly and calmly drawing the final \ntouches for the military breakthrough awaiting the Muslims, by Allâh’s Will. He \nappointed Khalid bin Al-Waleed as a leader of the right flank of the army with Aslam, \nSulaim, Ghifar, Muzainah and Juhainah tribes under his command to enter Makkah \nthrough its lower avenues. Az-Zubair bin ‘Awwam was to lead the left flank and \nwould storm Makkah from the upper side holding up the Messenger’s banner. Abu \n‘Ubaidah took command of the infantry and was to penetrate into the city via a side \nvalley. They were given full and decisive orders not to kill unless in self defence and \nin that case they would exterminate any aggressive elements and quell any \nopposition. \nThe Muslim battalions marched out each in its already drawn route to fulfill the \nmissions they were supposed to carry out. Khalid bin Al-Waleed worked his way into \nthe heart of the town quite successively killing twelve of the ruffians and sustaining \ntwo martyrs. Az-Zubair set out and reached the fixed destination where he planted \nthe banner at Al-Fath (conquest) Mosque and waited there for the arrival of the \nProphet [pbuh]. A tent was pitched for him where he offered prayers of thanks to the \nAll-Mighty Allâh, Who, out of His immense grace, had granted him a splendid victory. \nBut he did not repose long. He, in the company of the Helpers and Emigrants, got up \nand proceeded towards Al-Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, which is an emblem of the \nOneness and Supremacy of Allâh. It was unfortunately infested with idols that \n\n253\nnumbered 360. He knocked them down with his bow while reciting the verse of the \nNoble Qur’ân: \n\"And Say: ‘Truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism or this Qur’ân or Jihâd against \npolytheists) has come and Batil (falsehood, i.e. Satan or polytheism, etc.) \nhas vanished. Surely! Batil is ever bound to vanish.’\" [Al-Qur'an 17:81] \nAnd Allâh further said: \n\"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): \"The Truth (the Qur’ân and Allah’s \nInspiration) has come, and Al-Batil (falsehood - Iblis) can neither create \nanything nor resurrect (any thing).\" [Al-Qur'an 34:49] \nHe then started the usual circumambulation on his ride. He was not in a state of \nIhram (ritual consecration) then. On completion, he called for ‘Uthman bin Talhah, \nthe janitor of Al-Ka‘bah, from whom he took the key. He went in and saw images of \nProphets Ibrahim and Ishmael, [AWS], throwing divination arrows. He denounced \nthese acts of Quraish and ordered that all idols be dismantled, images and effigies \ndeleted. He then entered the sacred hall to face the wall opposite the door and there \nagain performed devout prostrations, and went around acclaiming Allâh’s Greatness \nand Oneness. Shortly afterwards, he returned to the door-way and standing upon its \nelevated step, gazed in thankfulness on the thronging multitude below and delivered \nthe following celebrated address: \n\"There is no god but Allâh Alone. He has no associates. He made good His Promise \nthat He held to His slave and helped him and defeated all the Confederates along. \nBear in mind that every claim of privilege, whether that of blood, or property, is \nunder my heel, except that of the custody of Al-Ka‘bah and supplying of water to the \npilgrims. Bear in mind that for anyone who is slain, even though semi-deliberately, \nwith club or whip, for him the blood-money is very severe: a hundred camels, forty \nof them to be pregnant. \n\"O people of Quraish! surely Allâh has abolished from you all pride of the \npre-Islamic era and all conceit in your ancestry, (because) all men are \ndescended from Adam, and Adam was made out of clay.\" \nHe then recited to them the verse: \n\"O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you \ninto nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most \nhonourable of you near Allâh is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. one \nof the Muttaqûn: i.e. pious and righteous persons who fear Allâh much \n(abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden), and \nlove Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)]. \nVerily, Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Aware.\" [Al-Qur'an 49:13] \nHe further added: \n\"O you people of Quraish! What do you think of the treatment that I am \nabout to accord to you?\" \n\n254\nThey replied: \n\"O noble brother and son of noble brother! We expect nothing but goodness \nfrom you.\" \nUpon this he said: \n\"I speak to you in the same words as Yusuf (the Prophet Joseph) spoke \nunto his brothers: He said: \"No reproach on you this day,\" [Al-Qur'an 12:92] \ngo your way, for you are freed ones.\" \nAs for the door-keeping of Al-Ka‘bah and supplying of water to pilgrims, the Prophet \n[pbuh] ordered that these jobs remain in the hand of ‘Uthman bin Talhah and that \nthe key will stay with him and his descendants for ever. \nWhen time for prayer approached, Bilal ascended Al-Ka‘bah and called for prayer. \nAbu Sufyan bin Harb, ‘Itab bin Usaid and Al-Harith bin Hisham were meanwhile \nsitting in the yard. ‘Itab bin Usaid commented on the new situation (Bilal ascending \nAl-Ka‘bah and calling for prayer) saying that Allâh honoured Usaid (his father) having \nnot heard such words. The Prophet [pbuh] approached and assisted by Divine \nRevelation told them that he had learnt about what they had spoken of. Al-Harith \nand ‘Itab, taken by incredible surprise, immediately professed Islam and bore \nwitness to the Messengership of Muhammad [pbuh] adding that \"We swear by Allâh \nthat none had been with us to inform you.\" \nOn that very day, the Prophet [pbuh] entered ‘Umm Hani’s house where he washed \nand offered prayers of victory. ‘Umm Hani had sheltered two Makkan relatives of \nhers in her house in which act she was granted support by the Prophet [pbuh]. \nShedding blood of nine arch-criminals was declared lawful even under the curtains of \nAl-Ka‘bah. Nevertheless, only four of them were killed while the others were \npardoned for different reasons. As for those who were killed, mention could be made \nof ‘Abdul ‘Uzza bin Khatal who had become a Muslim and then deputed to collect \nalms-tax in the company of a Helper. They had also a slave with them. ‘Abdullah, in \na fit of rage, killed the Helper’s slave on account of a mere trifling dispute, and \njoined the pagan Arabs as an apostate. He was never repentant at this heinous crime \nbut rather employed two women singers and incited them to sing satirically about \nthe Prophet [pbuh]. \nThe other man who was put to death was Miqyas bin Sababa. He was a Muslim. A \nHelper accidently killed his brother Hisham. The Prophet [pbuh] had arranged the \npayment of blood money to him, which he had accepted. His revengeful nature, \nhowever, was never appeased, so he killed the Helper and went to Makkah as an \napostate. \nSimilarly, Huw",

To Wahshi, the murderer of Hamzah, the Prophet’s uncle, and \nto Hind, who had chewed his liver, was also extended his generous clemency. The \n\n255\nsame generous treatment was accorded to Habar who had attacked the Prophet’s \ndaughter with a spear, while on her way from Makkah to Madinah, so grievously that \nshe ultimately died of the fatal injuries. \nIn the same context of magnanimity peculiar to Muhammad [pbuh], two chiefs of \nQuraish were pardoned once they had embraced Islam. They were Safwan bin \nOmaiyah and Fudalah bin ‘Umair. The latter had attempted to assassinate the \nProphet [pbuh] while circumambulating in the Holy Sanctuary. The Prophet’s \nmatchless tolerance and broad-mindedness instigated by his mission as ‘A mercy to \nall people’, converted a terrible hypocrite into a faithful devout believer. \nOn the second day of the great conquest, the Prophet [pbuh] stood up and \naddressed the people in matters relating to the holy status of Makkah. After \nentertaining Allâh’s praise, he proclaimed that Makkah was a holy land and would \nremain so till the Day of Judgement. No bloodshed was allowed therein. Should \nanyone take the liberty of fighting within Makkah on grounds derived from the \nevents that characterized the conquest, he should remember that it had been a \nlicence granted temporarily to the Prophet, and virtually does not go for others. Ibn \n‘Abbas [R] narrated: The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Allâh has made Makkah, a sanctuary, \nso it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was \nmade legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not \nallowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or \nto pick up its fallen things except by a person who would announce that (what has \nfound) publicly.\" Al-‘Abbas said: \"O Allâh’s Messenger! Except the lemon grass (for it \nis used) by our goldsmiths and for our homes.\" The Prophet [pbuh] then said: \n\"Except the lemon grass.\" \nIn this context, out of the spirit of revenge, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah killed a man \nfrom Laith Tribe. Here the Prophet was indignant and ordered Khuza‘ah to stop those \npre-Islamic practices. He, moreover, gave the family of anyone killed the right to \nconsider either of two options, blood-money or just retribution (the killer is killed). \nAfter having delivered his address, the Prophet [pbuh] rode to a small hill, Safa, not \nfar from Al-Ka‘bah. Turning his face towards the Sacred House, amidst a vast \nadmiring and devotional multitude, he raised his hand in fervent prayer to Allâh. The \ncitizens of Madinah who had gathered round him entertained fear, as Allâh had given \nhim victory over his native city, he might choose to stay here. He insisted on \nexplanation of their fear and so they spoke openly. He immediately dispelled their \nfears and assured them that he had lived with them and would die with them. \nImmediately after the great conquest, the Makkans came to realize that the only way \nto success lay in the avenue of Islam. They complied with the new realities and \ngathered to pledge fealty to the Prophet [pbuh]. The men came first pledging full \nobedience in all areas they can afford. Then came the women to follow the men’s \nexample. The Prophet [pbuh] with ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab receiving the pledge of \nfealty and communicating to them for him.

On returning home, she broke her idol \nadmitting her delusion as regards stone-gods. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] stayed in Makkah for 19 days. During that period he \nused to define the way to Islam, guide people to the orthodox path. He ordered Abu \nUsaid Al-Khuza‘i to restore the pillars of the Holy Sanctuary, sent missions to all \nquarters inviting them to adopt Islam and break down the graven images still lying in \nthe vicinity of Makkah, and he did have all of them scrapped, inculcating in the \nbelievers’ ears his words: \n\"Whoever believes in Allâh and the Hereafter is supposed to scrap out the \nidols that should happen to be in his house.\" \nShortly after the great conquest, the Prophet [pbuh] began to despatch platoons and \nerrands aiming at eliminating the last symbols reminiscent of pre-Islamic practices. \nHe sent Khalid bin Al-Waleed in Ramadan 8 A.H. to a spot called Nakhlah where \nthere was a goddess called Al-‘Uzza venerated by Quraish and Kinanah tribes. It had \ncustodians from Bani Shaiban. Khalid, at the head of thirty horsemen arrived at the \nspot and exterminated it. On his return, the Prophet [pbuh] asked him if he had seen \nanything there, to which Khalid gave a negative answer. Here, he was told that it \nhad not been destroyed and he had to go there again and fulfill the task. He went \nback again and there he saw a black woman, naked with torn hair. Khalid struck her \nwith his sword into two parts. He returned and narrated the story to the Prophet \n[pbuh], who then confirmed the fulfillment of the task. \nLater, in the same month, ‘Amr bin Al-‘As was sent on an errand to destroy another \nidol, venerated by Hudhail, called Suwa‘. It used to stand at a distance of three \nkilometres from Makkah. On a question posed by the door-keeper, ‘Amr said he had \nbeen ordered by the Prophet [pbuh] to knock down the idol. The man warned ‘Amr \nthat he would not be able to do it. ‘Amr was surprised to see someone still in the \nwrong, approached the idol and destroyed it, then he broke the casket beside it but \nfound nothing. The man immediately embraced Islam. \nSa‘d bin Zaid Al-Ashhali was also sent in the same month and on the same mission \nto Al-Mashallal to destroy an idol, Manat, venerated by both Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj \ntribes. Here also a black woman, naked with messy hair appeared wailing and \nbeating on her chest. Sa‘d immediately killed her, destroyed the idol and broke the \ncasket and returned at the conclusion of his errand. \nKhalid bin Al-Waleed at the head of 350 horsemen of Helpers, Emigrants and Bani \nSaleem was despatched once again in the same year 8 A.H. to the habitation of Bani \nKhuzaimah bedouins to invite them to the fold of Islam. He was instructed to carry \nout his mission with peace and goodwill. There, the people were not articulate \nenough to communicate their intentions, so Khalid ordered his men to kill them and \ntake the others as captives. He even had in mind to kill the captives but some of the \nCompanions were opposed to his plan. News of bloodshed reached the Prophet \n[pbuh]. He was deeply grieved and raised his hands towards the heaven, uttering \n\n257\nthese words: \"O Allâh! I am innocent of what Khalid has done,\" twice. [Sahih Al-\nBukhari 1/450, 2/622] He immediately sent ‘Ali to make every possible reparation to \nthe tribes who had been wronged. After a careful inquiry, ‘Ali paid the blood-money \nto all those who suffered loss. The remaining portion was also distributed amongst \nthe members of the tribe in order to alleviate their suffering. Khalid, due to his \nirrational behaviour, had a row with ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf. Hearing this, the \nProphet [pbuh] got angry, and ordered Khalid to stop that altercation adding that his \nCompanions (meaning ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf) were too high in rank to be involved \nin such arguments. \nThat is the story of the conquest of Makkah and the decisive battle that exterminated \npaganism once and for all. The other tribes in the Arabian Peninsula were waiting \nand closely watching the final outcome of the bitter struggle between the Muslims \nand idolaters, already convinced that the Holy Sanctuary would not fall but in the \nhands of the righteous party. It had been a conviction deeply established in their \nminds ever since the elephant army of Abraha Al-Ashram advanced from Yemen \nintending to destroy the Sacred House 50 years before. \nAl-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty was the natural prelude to this great victory in which \npeople believed deeply and over which people talked a lot.

For it affected the course of events and consequently altered the \nArabs’ whole life. It was a decisive distinction between preconquest and post-\nconquest periods. For Quraish, at that time, was in the eyes of Arabs the defenders \nand helpers of Arabs. Other Arabs are only their ancillaries. The submission of \nQuraish is, therefore, estimated to be a final elimination of paganism in the Arabian \nPeninsula. \nThis stage can be divided into two main phases: \nThe phase of: \n1. holy wars and fighting. \n2. the tribes and people’s race to embrace Islam. \nBeing so close and rather inseparable, the two phases of this stage intervene in such \na way that a happening of one phase occurs during the progress of the other. \nHowever, we have preferred — for expository purposes — to deal with these two \nphases distinctively. The fighting phase was given the priority in order, due to the \nfact that it is more intimate and fit than the other. \nHunain Ghazwah \nThe conquest of Makkah which came forth as a consequence of a swift blow \nastounded both the Arabs and other tribes who realized that they were doomed and \nhad to submit to the new situation as a fait accompli. Some of the fierce, powerful \nproud tribes did not submit and favoured resistance. Ahead of these were the septs \nof Hawazin and Thaqif. Nasr, Jashm and Sa‘d bin Bakr and people of Bani Hilal — all \nof whom of Qais ‘Ailan. They thought that they were too mighty to admit or \nsurrender to such a victory. So they met Malik bin ‘Awf An-Nasri and made up their \nmind to proceed fighting against the Muslims. \nThe Enemy’s March and their Encampment at Awtas \nWhen Malik bin ‘Awf — the general leader — decided to march and fight the Muslims, \nhe made his countrypeople take their wealth, women and children with them to \nAwtas — which is a valley in Hawazin land and is quite near Hunain. It differs from \nHunain in its being adjacent to Dhi-Al-Majaz which is around ten miles from Makkah \nin ‘Arafat’s direction. [Fath Al-Bari 8/27,42] \n\n259\nThe War-experienced Man wrongs the Leader’s Judgement \nAs soon as they had camped in Awtas, people crowded round Malik. The old sane \nDuraid bin As-Simmah, who was well-known as a war-experienced man, and who \nwas among those who gathered round Malik, asked: \"What valley are we in?\" \"In \nAwtas,\" they said. \"What a good course it is for horses! It is neither a sharp pointed \nheight nor a loosed soiled plain. What? Why do I hear camels’ growling, the donkeys’ \nbraying, the children’s cries and the sheep bleating?\" asked Duraid. They said: \"Malik \nbin ‘Awf had made people bring their women, properties and children with them.\" So \nhe called Malik and asked him what made him do such a thing. Malik said that his \naim was to have everybody’s family and properties around them so that they fight \nfiercely to protect them.\" \"I swear by Allâh that you are nothing but a shepherd,\" \nanswered Duraid, \"Do you believe that there is anything whatsoever, can stand in \nthe way of a defeated one or stop him from fleeing? If you win the battle you avail \nnothing but a man with a sword and a spear; but if you lose you will bring disgrace \non your people and properties,\" then he resumed his talk and went on wondering \nabout some septs and their leaders. \"O Malik, thrusting the distinguished people of \nHawazin into the battlefield will avail you nothing. Raise them up to where they can \nbe safe. Then make the young people mount their horses and fight.

What happened to you?\" Said Malik. They said: \"We \nhave seen distinguished people on spotted horsebacks. What you see, would not \nhave happened if we had been firmly together.\" \nReconnoitering the Enemy’s Weapons \nNews about the enemy’s marching were conveyed to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], \nso he sent out Al-Aslami with orders to mix with people, stay with them so that he \nwould be able to know their news and to convey it to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nwhen he turns back. That was exactly what he managed to do. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] leaves Makkah for Hunain \nOn Shawwal, the nineteenth, the captive day, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] left \nMakkah accompanied by twelve thousand Muslims. Ten thousand of those had \npreviously shared in Makkah Conquest. A great number of the other two thousand, \nwho were Makkans, had recently embraced Islam. That march was on the nineteenth \nday of his conquest to Makkah. He borrowed a hundred armours with their \n\n260\nequipment from Safwan bin Omaiyah. He appointed ‘Itab bin Usaid as a governor \nover Makkah. When it was evening time, a horseman came to the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] and said: \"I have climbed up so and so mountains and came across Hawazin \nwith their riding camels, livestock and sheep. Hawazin wholly were gathered together \nthere.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] smiled then and said: \"They will all be \nMuslims’ spoils tomorrow, if Allâh will.\" That night Anas bin Abi Murthid Al-Ghanawi \nvolunteered to guard. [Abu Da'ud] \nOn their way to Hunain they saw a great green Nabk plant, that was called Dhat-\nAnwat (the one with suspenders). That was because the Arabs used to hang their \nweapons on it, slay beasts under it and keep to it. So some of army members asked \nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to make them a Nabk with suspenders as the one \nthey had. \"Allâh is the Greatest of all!\" He said, \"I swear by the One in Whose Hand \nis Muhammad’s soul, that you have just said what the people of Moses said to him. \nThey said ‘Make us a god as the one they have.’ Surely you are ignorant people. \nThese are Sunnah, but you will follow and comply with the modes of life of those who \npreceded you.\" [At-Tirmidhi] \nSeeing how great in number the army was, some of them said: \"We shall not be \ndefeated.\" Their statement sounded hard upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. \nThe Islamic Army stunned the Archers and the Attackers \nOn Wednesday night the tenth of Shawwal, the Muslim army arrived at Hunain. Malik \nbin ‘Awf, who had previously entered the valley by night, gave orders to his army to \nhide inside the valley and lurk for the Muslims on roads, entrances, narrow hiding \nplaces. His orders to his men were to hurl stones at Muslims whenever they caught \nsight of them and then to make a one-man attack against them. \nAt early dawn the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started mobilizing his army and \ndistributing posts and flags to people. In the dark and just before dawn the Muslims \nmoved towards Hunain Valley. They started descending into it unaware of the \npresence of an enemy lurking for them inside the valley. So at the moment they \nwere camping, arrows began showering intensively at them, whereas the enemy’s \nbattalions started a fierce attack against the Muslims, who had to retreat in disorder \nand utter confusion. It was such a shatteringly defeat that Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who \nhad recently embraced Islam, said that their retreat would not stop till they got to \nthe Red Sea. Jablah or Kildah bin Al-Junaid commented on that by saying: \"Surely \nmagic has grown inactive today.\" \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned to the right and said: \"Come on, people! I am \nthe Messenger of Allâh. I am Muhammad, the son of Abdullah.\" Those who stoodfast \nby him were only few Emigrants and some of his kinsmen. The matchless bravery of \nthe Prophet [R] was then brought to light. He went on and on in his attempts to \nmake his mule standfast in the face of the disbelievers while saying loudly: \n\"Truly saying, I am the Prophet \nI am the (grand) son of Abdul Muttalib.\" \n\n261\nHowever, Abu Sufyan, who was then holding the rein of the Prophet’s mule, and Al-\n‘Abbas, who was holding its stirrup; were endeavouring to make it halt.

What you see, would not \nhave happened if we had been firmly together.\" \nReconnoitering the Enemy’s Weapons \nNews about the enemy’s marching were conveyed to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], \nso he sent out Al-Aslami with orders to mix with people, stay with them so that he \nwould be able to know their news and to convey it to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nwhen he turns back. That was exactly what he managed to do. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] leaves Makkah for Hunain \nOn Shawwal, the nineteenth, the captive day, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] left \nMakkah accompanied by twelve thousand Muslims. Ten thousand of those had \npreviously shared in Makkah Conquest. A great number of the other two thousand, \nwho were Makkans, had recently embraced Islam. That march was on the nineteenth \nday of his conquest to Makkah. He borrowed a hundred armours with their \n\n260\nequipment from Safwan bin Omaiyah. He appointed ‘Itab bin Usaid as a governor \nover Makkah. When it was evening time, a horseman came to the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] and said: \"I have climbed up so and so mountains and came across Hawazin \nwith their riding camels, livestock and sheep. Hawazin wholly were gathered together \nthere.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] smiled then and said: \"They will all be \nMuslims’ spoils tomorrow, if Allâh will.\" That night Anas bin Abi Murthid Al-Ghanawi \nvolunteered to guard. [Abu Da'ud] \nOn their way to Hunain they saw a great green Nabk plant, that was called Dhat-\nAnwat (the one with suspenders). That was because the Arabs used to hang their \nweapons on it, slay beasts under it and keep to it. So some of army members asked \nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to make them a Nabk with suspenders as the one \nthey had. \"Allâh is the Greatest of all!\" He said, \"I swear by the One in Whose Hand \nis Muhammad’s soul, that you have just said what the people of Moses said to him. \nThey said ‘Make us a god as the one they have.’ Surely you are ignorant people. \nThese are Sunnah, but you will follow and comply with the modes of life of those who \npreceded you.\" [At-Tirmidhi] \nSeeing how great in number the army was, some of them said: \"We shall not be \ndefeated.\" Their statement sounded hard upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. \nThe Islamic Army stunned the Archers and the Attackers \nOn Wednesday night the tenth of Shawwal, the Muslim army arrived at Hunain. Malik \nbin ‘Awf, who had previously entered the valley by night, gave orders to his army to \nhide inside the valley and lurk for the Muslims on roads, entrances, narrow hiding \nplaces. His orders to his men were to hurl stones at Muslims whenever they caught \nsight of them and then to make a one-man attack against them. \nAt early dawn the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started mobilizing his army and \ndistributing posts and flags to people. In the dark and just before dawn the Muslims \nmoved towards Hunain Valley. They started descending into it unaware of the \npresence of an enemy lurking for them inside the valley. So at the moment they \nwere camping, arrows began showering intensively at them, whereas the enemy’s \nbattalions started a fierce attack against the Muslims, who had to retreat in disorder \nand utter confusion. It was such a shatteringly defeat that Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who \nhad recently embraced Islam, said that their retreat would not stop till they got to \nthe Red Sea. Jablah or Kildah bin Al-Junaid commented on that by saying: \"Surely \nmagic has grown inactive today.\" \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned to the right and said: \"Come on, people! I am \nthe Messenger of Allâh. I am Muhammad, the son of Abdullah.\" Those who stoodfast \nby him were only few Emigrants and some of his kinsmen. The matchless bravery of \nthe Prophet [R] was then brought to light. He went on and on in his attempts to \nmake his mule standfast in the face of the disbelievers while saying loudly: \n\"Truly saying, I am the Prophet \nI am the (grand) son of Abdul Muttalib.\" \n\n261\nHowever, Abu Sufyan, who was then holding the rein of the Prophet’s mule, and Al-\n‘Abbas, who was holding its stirrup; were endeavouring to make it halt.

    "content": "aign is in fact an extension of Hunain Ghazwah; that is because the \nmajority of the defeated troops of Hawazin and Thaqif went into Ta’if with the \ngeneral commander — Malik bin ‘Awf An-Nasri — and fortified themselves within it. \nSo upon finishing with Hunain Invasion, he gathered the booty at Al-Ji‘ranah in the \nvery month (i.e. Shawwal) and in the eighth year A.H. \nA vanguard battalion of a thousand men led by Khalid bin Al-Waleed marched \ntowards At-Ta’if. Whereas the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] proceeded passing through \nNakhlah Al-Yamaniyah, Qarn Al-Manazil and through Laiyah. At Laiyah there was a \ncastle that belonged to Malik bin ‘Awf, so the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave orders \nto have it destroyed. He resumed his march till he got to Ta’if. There he dismounted, \ncamped near its castle and laid siege to the castle inhabitants; but not for long. \nHow long the siege continued, is still a matter of disagreement. It however stands \nbetween 10-20 days. [Sahih Muslim, narrated by Anas [AWS]; Fath Al-Bari 8/45] \nA lot of arrow-shooting and rock-hurling occurred during the siege. For as soon as \nthe Muslims laid siege round the castle, its people started shooting arrows against \nthem. The arrows were so intense and fierce that they looked as if they had been \nlocusts on the move. A number of Muslims were wounded and twelve were killed. \nTo be far from the arrow-range, the Muslims had to ascend to a higher location and \ncamped on — i.e. to what is now called At-Ta’if Mosque. The Prophet [pbuh] set up a \nmangonel and shelled the castle. Eventually a gap was made in the castle wall, \nthrough which a number of Muslims managed to pass into the castle, sheltered by a \nwooden tank, with the purpose of setting fire into it. Anyway, the enemy poured \n\n263\ndown molten hot iron on them. Affected by this the Muslims stepped out of the tank \nand were again exposed to arrow shooting and consequently some of them were \nkilled. \nTo force the enemy to surrender, the Prophet [pbuh] tended to a war policy of \nburning and cutting the enemy’s crops. His order was to cut their vineyards and burn \nthem. Seeing that the Muslims started rapidly cutting and burning their vines, they \nimplored the Prophet [pbuh] to stop and have mercy on them for the sake of Allâh \nand out of kinship motives. So the Prophet agreed. When the caller of the Messenger \nof Allâh [pbuh] called out unto people saying \"He whosoever descends and steps out \nof the castle is free.\" Twenty-three men came out. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/620] One of \nthem was Abu Bakrah who tied himself to a wall and let himself down by means of a \nsmall wheel, that would normally be used for drawing up water from a well. The way \nhe let himself down made the Prophet nickname him \"Abu Bakrah\", i.e. the man with \nthe wheel. The Messenger of Allâh Õáì Çááå",

He said: \"They are like a fox hiding inside its burrow. If you stoodfast at \nit you would catch it, but if you parted with it, no harm would afflict you.\" The \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] decided to lift the siege and depart. ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, \nwho was ordered by the Prophet to notify people, said to them \"If Allâh will, we are \nleaving the castle and going back tomorrow.\" As it was too hard for the Muslims to \ngo back and leave the castle unconquered they complained saying, \"Should we go \naway while the castle is still unopened?\" His reply was: \"Then, start fighting in the \nmorning.\" In the morning they fought and were wounded. So when he repeated this \nstatement: \"If Allâh will, we are leaving the castle and going back tomorrow\", they \nwere pleased and carried out the order submissively and started moving, which \nmade the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] laugh. \nAs soon as they mounted and started moving the Messenger [pbuh] said: \n\"Say! Here we are returning, repenting, worshipping (Allâh) and to our Lord \nwe offer praise.\" \nWhen the Messenger of Allâh was asked to invoke Allâh against Thaqif, he said: \n\"O Allâh, guide Thaqif and bring them to us as Muslims.\" \nThe Distribution of the Booty at Al-Ji‘ranah \nUpon returning and lifting the siege in Ta’if, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had \nstayed over ten nights at Al-Ji‘ranah before starting to distribute the booty. \nDistribution delay was due to the Prophet’s hope that Hawazin’s delegation might \narrive and announce their repentance and consequently reclaim their loss. Seeing \nthat none of them arrived, he started dividing the booty so as to calm down the \ntribes’ chiefs and the celebrities of Makkah. The first to receive booty and the ones \n\n264\nwho obtained the greatest number of shares were the people who had recently \nembraced Islam. \nAbu Sufyan bin Harb was given a hundred camels and forty (gold) ounces and yet he \nsaid, \"What about my son, Yazeed’s Share?\" So he was given the same quantity for \nhis son as well. But yet he exclaimed: \"And what about the share of Mu‘âwiyah, my \nsecond son?\" So the Prophet [pbuh] gave Mu‘âwiyah as much as he gave his father \nand brother. Hakeem bin Hizam was given a hundred camels, but he was given a \nhundred more when he demanded. Safwan bin Omaiyah was given three hundred \ncamels - a hundred camels at each time. It is thus mentioned in Shifâ’ [Ash-Shifa \n1/86], Book by Qadi Iyadh. The Prophet [pbuh] gave Al-Harith bin Harith bin Kilda a \nhundred camels. He also gave some chiefs of Quraish and other clans a hundred \ncamels; he gave others fifty and some others had forty. \nEventually it was spread among people that \"Muhammad grants generously and \nfears not to grow poor.\" This made bedouins gather around him expecting to be \ngiven some wealth. They were so many that they forced the Prophet [pbuh] to seek \nrefuge against a tree and they even took away his garment, \"O people!\" He said, \n\"Give me back my garment! For I swear by the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s \nsoul, that if I had as many numerous camels as the number of Tihama trees, I would \ndistribute them among you. You know quite well that I am neither mean nor coward \nor a liar.\" Standing by his camel he plucked out a hair of his camel’s hump and held \nit between his two fingers, lifted it up and said: \"O people, I swear by Allâh that I get \nnothing but one-fifth of your booty, and this very fifth goes back to you.\" \nAs soon as he had given the new converts, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered \nZaid bin Thabit to fetch the booty and summon people. Then he ordained shares to \npeople. A footman’s share was four camels and forty sheep, and a horseman would \ntake twelve camels and a hundred and twenty sheep. This distribution of booty was \nbased on a wise policy. In this world there are lots of people who know the truth only \nwhen it comes through their stomachs and they do not recognize it if it comes \nthrough their brains. The similitude of such people is as the guidance of an animal to \nits herd by means of a bunch of clover held at a constant distance off its mouth.

The Helpers \nwere among those who were afflicted by this policy. They were deprived of Hunain \ngifts though they had been the ones who were summoned at Hunain hard times and \nthey were the first to rush to fight with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and standfast \ntill the defeat turned into victory. Now here they are watching those who escaped fill \ntheir hands with booty while they are given nothing. \nOn the authority of Ibn Ishaq: \"When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had given \nQuraish and Arab tribes those gifts and allotted nothing to the Helpers, a group of \nthe Helpers felt so uneasy about it that a lot of ill-statements against the Prophet \n[pbuh] were spread among them to an extent that one of them said: \"By Allâh, the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] was ill-spoken of by his folksmen!\" And those ill-\n\n265\nstatements went on spreading till Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah met the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh], who in his turn faced his people after a while. \nSa‘d bin ‘Ubadah said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, this group of the Helpers are furious at \nyou about the distribution of the booty that you had won. You have allotted shares to \nyour own kinsmen and forwarded lots of gifts to the Arab tribes. But this group has \nobtained nothing.\" The Prophet [pbuh] asked Sa‘d exclaiming: \"Sa‘d, what do you \nthink of all that?\" Sa‘d replied: \"O Messenger of Allâh. You know that I am nothing \nbut a member of this group.\" \"Call out on your people and bring them forth to me \ninto this shed.\" Said the Prophet [pbuh]. \nSo Sa‘d went out and summoned them. When some Emigrants came, he let them in \nbut forbade others. When they were all gathered together, he informed the Prophet \nsaying: \"This group of the Helpers have just arrived to meet you in compliance with \nyour orders.\" As soon as the Messenger [pbuh] faced them he thanked Allâh and \npraised Him, then said to them inquiring, \"I have been told that you are angry with \nme. Didn’t I come to you when you were astray and Allâh guided you? You were poor \nand Allâh gave you wealth. Weren’t you foes and Allâh made you love one another.\" \n\"Yes,\" they said, \"Allâh and His Messenger are better and more gracious.\" Then he \nsaid: \"What prevents you from replying to the Messenger of Allâh, O tribe of \nHelpers?\" They said, \"What should be the reply, O Messenger of Allâh, while to the \nLord and to his Messenger belong all benevolence and grace.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] again said: \n\"But by Allâh, you might have answered and answered truly, for I would \nhave testified to its truth myself: ‘You came to us belied and rejected and \nwe accepted you; you came to us as helpless and we helped you; a fugitive, \nand we took you in; poor and we comforted you’. \nYou Helpers, do you feel anxious for the things of this world, wherewith I \nhave sought to incline these people unto the Faith in which you are already \nestablished? \nAre you not satisfied, O group of Helpers that the people go with ewes and \ncamels while you go along with the Messenger of Allâh ([pbuh]) to your \ndwellings. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, had there been no migration, I \nwould have been one of the Helpers. If the people would go through a valley \nand passage, and the Helpers go through another valley and passage, I \nwould go through the valley and passage of the Helpers. Allâh!

Those whose hearts were still full of \nprejudice against Islam and therefore were too proud to embrace Allâh’s religion, \nwere decisively muffled on their non-acquiescence in the status quo prevalent then in \nArabia. \nHere is a mini-image about the believed ones. We have already stated that the \nMessenger’s arrival in Madinah was by the last days of the eighth year of Al-Hijra. No \nsooner the crescent of Muharram of the ninth year turned up than the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] dispatched the believed ones, to the tribes as shown in the list below: \n1. ‘Uyaina bin Hisn \nto Bani Tamim. \n2. Yazeed bin Husain \nto Aslam and Ghifar. \n3. ‘Abbad bin Bishr Al-Ashhali \nto Sulaim and Muzainah. \n4. Rafi‘ bin Mukaith \nto Juhainah. \n5. ‘Amr bin Al-‘As \nto Bani Fazarah. \n6. Ad-Dahhak bin Sufyan \nto Bani Kilab. \n7. Basheer bin Sufyan \nto Bani Ka‘b. \n8. Ibn Al-Lutabiyah Al-Azdi \nto Bani Dhubyan. \n9. Al-Muhajir bin Abi Omaiyah \nto Sana‘a’ (Al-Aswad Al-‘Ansi called at him \nwhen he was in it). \n10. Ziyad bin Labid \nto Hadramout. \n11. ‘Adi bin Hatim \nto Tai’ and Bani Asad. \n12. Malik bin Nuwairah \nto Bani Hanzalah. \n13. Az-Zabraqan bin Badr \nto Bani Sa‘d (a portion of them). \n14. Qais bin ‘Asim \nto Bani Sa‘d (a portion of them). \n15. Al-‘Alâ’ bin Al-Hadrami \nto Al-Bahrain. \n16. ‘Ali bin Abi Talib \nto Najran (to collect Sadaqa & Jizya). \nSome of these agents were despatched in Muharram, 7 A.H., others were sent later \nuntil the tribes they were heading for had completely converted into Islam. Such a \nmove clearly demonstrates the great success that the Islamic Da‘wah (Call) enjoyed \nafter Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty. However, shortly after the conquest of Makkah, people \nbegan to embrace Islam in large hosts. \nThe Platoons \nIn the same way that the believed ones were dispatched to the tribes, we \nunderstand that dispatching some more platoons to all regions of Arabia is a \nnecessity for the prevalence and domination of security on all lands of Arabia. \nHere is a list of those platoons: \n1. ‘Uyaina bin Hisn Al-Fazari’s platoon in Al-Muharram, the ninth year of Al-Hijra \nto Bani Tamim. It consisted of fifty horsemen, none of them was an Emigrant \nor a Helper. \n\n269\nThis expedition was dispatched due to the fact that Bani Tamim had already \nurged other tribes not to pay tribute (Al-Jizya) and eventually stopped them \nfrom paying it. \nTherefore, ‘Uyaina bin Hisn set out to fight them. All the way long he marched \nby night and lurked by day. He went on that way till he overtook them and \nattacked them in the desert. They fled back for their lives. Eleven men, \ntwenty-one women and thirty boys were captured then. He drove them back \nto Madinah and were housed in Ramlah bint Al-Harith’s residence. Ten of their \nleaders, who came to the Prophet’s door, called out unto him saying: \"O \nMuhammad come out and face us.\" When he went out they held him and \nstarted talking. \nHe exchanged talk with them for a while then left them and went to perform \nthe noon-prayer. After prayer he sat in the mosque-patio. They proclaimed a \ndesire to show boasting and self-pride. For this purpose they introduced their \norator ‘Utarid bin Hajib who delivered his speech. The Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] asked Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas — the Muslim orator — to \nrespond. He did that. In return, they brought forth their poet Az-Zabraqan bin \nBadr who recited some boastful poetry. Hassan bin Thabit, the poet of Islam, \npromptly replied back.

On the way they distributed \nthe spoils and put aside the best things to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. \nThey did not share the Hatims. \nUpon arrival in Madinah, the sister of ‘Adi bin Hatim begged the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] to have mercy on her and said: \"O Messenger of Allâh, my \nbrother is absent and father is dead, and I am too old to render any service. \nBe beneficent to me so that Allâh may be bountiful to you.\" He said: \"Who is \nyour brother?\" She said: \"It is ‘Adi bin Hatim.\" \"Is he not the one who fled \nfrom Allâh and his Messenger?\" Said the Prophet [pbuh] then went away from \nher. Next day she reiterated the same thing as the day before and received \nthe same answer. A day later she uttered similar words, this time he made \nbenefaction to her. The man who was beside the Prophet, and whom she \nthought to be ‘Ali, said to her: \"Ask for an animal from him to ride on.\" And \nshe was granted her request. \nShe returned to Ash-Sham where she met her brother and said to him: \"The \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] has done me such noble deed that your father \nwould never have done it. Therefore, willy-nilly, frightened or secure, you \nshould go and see him.\" Unsecure neither protected by some one, not even \nrecommended by a letter as a means of protection, ‘Adi came and met the \nProphet. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] took him home with him. As soon as \nhe sat before him, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] thanked Allâh and praised \nhim, then said: \"What makes you flee? Do you flee lest you should say there \nis no god but Allâh? Do you know any other god but Allâh?\" \"No\" he said, \nthen talked for a while. The Messenger of Allâh went on saying: \"Certainly \nyou flee so that you may not hear the statement saying ‘Allâh is the \nGreatest.’ Do you know anyone who is greater than Allâh?\" \"No\" he said. \"The \nJews are those whose portion is wrath, and the Christians are those who have \ngone astray,\" the Prophet retorted. \"I am a Muslim and I believe in one God \n(Allâh).\" ‘Adi finally proclaimed with a joyous face. The Prophet ordered him a \nresidence with one of the Helpers. From that time he started calling at the \nProphet [pbuh] in the mornings and in the evenings. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/205] \nOn the authority of Ibn Ishaq, when the Prophet [pbuh] made him sit down in \nfront of him in his house, the Prophet said, \"O ‘Adi, were you not cast in \ndisbelief?\" \"Yes\". ‘Adi said. \"Did you not share one quarter of your people’s \ngains?\" \"Yes\". Said ‘Adi. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \"It is sinful in \nyour religion to do such a thing, and you should not allow yourself to do it.\" \n\"Yes, by Allâh, that is true\", said ‘Adi. \"Thus I worked out that he was a \nProphet inspired by Allâh, and sent to people. He knows what is unknown.\" [Ibn \nHisham 2/581] \nIn another version, the Prophet [pbuh] said: \"‘Adi, embrace Islam and you \nshall be secure.\" \"But I am a man of religion.\" Said ‘Adi. \"I know your religion \nbetter than you.\" Said the Prophet. \"Do you know my religion better than \nme?\" ‘Adi asked. The Prophet replied, \"Yes\". He said: \"Are you not cast in \ndisbelief because you appropriate to yourself the fourth of your people’s \ngains?\" \"Yes\". Said ‘Adi. \"It is unlawful in your religion to do such a thing.\" \nThe Prophet said, and ‘‘Adi added: \"He did not need to say it again for I \nimmediately acquiesced it.\" [Musnad Imam Ahmad] \n\n271\nAl-Bukhari narrates that ‘Adi said: While we were with the Prophet [pbuh], a man \ncame in and complained to him about poverty. Then another man came in and \ncomplained about highway robbery. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then said: \"O \n‘Adi, have you ever been to Al-Hirah? If you were doomed to live long life, you would \nbe able to see a riding camel woman travel from Hirah till it circumambulates Al-\nKa‘bah fearing none but Allâh; and if you were to live long enough you would open \nthe treasures of Kisra. And if you were to live long you would be able to see man \noffering a handful of gold or silver to others but none accepts to take it.\" At the end \nof this Hadith ‘Adi later on says: \"I have seen a riding camel woman travel from Al-\nHirah till it circumambulates the Ka‘bah fearing none but Allâh, I have also been one \nof those who opened the treasures of Kisra bin Hurmuz.

As a result of which, the Arabs had no more doubt in \nMuhammad’s mission. Thus we see that things went contrary to the pagans’ \nexpectations. People started to embrace Islam, the religion of Allâh, in great \nnumbers. This is manifested clearly in the chapter — The delegations, of this book. It \ncan also be deduced out of the enormous number of people who shared in the \nHajjatul-Wadâ‘ (Farewell Pilgrimage). All domestic troubles came to an end. Muslims, \neventually felt at ease and started setting up the teachings of Allâh’s Laws and \nintensifying the Call to Islam. \nThe underlying Reasons \nThe Byzantine power, which was considered the greatest military force on earth at \nthat time, showed an unjustifiable opposition towards Muslims. As we have already \nmentioned, their opposition started at killing the ambassador of the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh], Al-Harith bin ‘Umair Al-Azdi, by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr Al-Ghassani. The \nambassador was then carrying a message from the Prophet [pbuh] to the ruler of \nBusra. We have also stated that the Prophet consequently dispatched a brigade \nunder the command of Zaid bin Haritha, who had a fierce fight against the \nByzantines at Mu’tah. Although Muslim forces could not have revenge on those \nhaughty overproud tyrants, the confrontation itself had a great impression on the \nArabs, all over Arabia. \nCaesar — who could neither ignore the great benefit that Mu’tah Battle had brought \nto Muslims, nor could he disregard the Arab tribes’ expectations of independence, \nand their hopes of getting free from his influence and reign, nor he could ignore their \nalliance to the Muslims — realizing all that, Caesar was aware of the progressive \ndanger threatening his borders, especially Ash-Sham-fronts which were neighbouring \nArab lands. So he concluded that demolition of the Muslims power had grown an \nurgent necessity. This decision of his should, in his opinion, be achieved before the \nMuslims become too powerful to conquer, and raise troubles and unrest in the \nadjacent Arab territories. \nTo meet these exigencies, Caesar mustered a huge army of the Byzantines and pro-\nRoman Ghassanide tribes to launch a decisive bloody battle against the Muslims. \nGeneral News about the Byzantines and Ghassanide Preparations for War \nNo sooner news about the Byzantine’s preparations for a decisive invasion against \nMuslims reached Madinah than fear spread among them. They started to envisage \nthe Byzantine invasion in the least sound they could hear. This could be clearly \nworked out of what had happened to ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab one day. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] had taken an oath to stay off his wives for a month in the ninth \nyear of Al-Hijra. Therefore, he deserted them and kept off in a private place. At the \nbeginning, the Companions of the Messenger of Allâh were puzzled and could not \nwork out the reason for such behaviour. They thought the Prophet [pbuh] had \n\n273\ndivorced them and that was why he was grieved, disturbed and upset. In ‘Umar’s \nversion of the very story he says: \"I used to have a Helper friend who often informed \nme about what happened if I weren’t present, and in return I always informed him of \nwhat had taken place during his absence. They both lived in the high part of \nMadinah. Both of them used to call at the Prophet alternatively during that time of \nsuspense.

When it was his turn to convey the news to me, he went down and returned in \nthe evening. He knocked at the door violently and said ‘Is he sleeping?’ I was \nterrified but I went out to meet him. ‘Something serious had taken place.’ He said. \n‘Has the Ghassaindes arrived?’ Said I. ‘No,’ he said, ‘it is greater and more serious. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] has divorced his wives.’\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/334] \nThis state of too much alertness manifests clearly the seriousness of the situation \nthat Muslims began to experience. The seriousness of the situation was confirmed to \na large degree by the hypocrites behaviour, when news about the Byzantines’ \npreparations reached Madinah. The fact that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] won all \nthe battles he fought, and that no power on earth could make him terrified, and that \nhe had always proved to be able to overcome all the obstacles that stood in his way - \ndid not prevent the hypocrites, who concealed evil in their hearts, from expecting an \naffliction to fall upon the Muslims and Islam. \nThey used to harbour evil and ill-intentions against the whole process of Islam and \nthe Muslims. On grounds of illusory hopes of destroying this great religious edifice, \nthey erected a hotbed of conspiracy and intrigue in the form of a mosque — Masjid-\ne-Darar (the mosque of harm). They approached the Prophet [pbuh] with the \nrequest that he should come and consecrate the place by praying in it himself. As he \nwas at the moment about to start for Tabuk, he deferred compliance with their \nrequest till his return. Meanwhile he came to know through Divine Revelation that it \nwas not a Mosque for devotion and prayer but a meeting place for the anti-Islamic \nelements. On his return, therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] sent a party to demolish the \nnew structure. \nParticular News about the Byzantine and Ghassanide Preparations for War \nA magnified image of the prominent danger threatening the Muslims life was carried \nto them by the Nabateans who brought oil from Ash-Sham to Madinah. They carried \nnews about Heraclius’ preparations and equipment of an enormous army counting \nover forty thousand fighters besides Lukham, Judham and other tribes allied to the \nByzantines. They said that its vanguard had already reached Al-Balqâ’. Thus was the \ngrave situation standing in ambush for the Muslims. The general situation was \naggravated seriously by other adverse factors of too much hot weather, drought and \nthe rough and rugged distance they had to cover in case they decided to encounter \nthe imminent danger. \nThe Messenger of Allâh’s [pbuh] concept and estimation of the situation and its \ndevelopment was more precise and accurate than all others. He thought that if he \ntarried or dealt passively with the situation in such a way that might enable the \n\n274\nByzantines to paddle through the Islamic controlled provinces or to go as far as \nMadinah, this would — amid these circumstances — leave the most awful impression \non Islam as well as on the Muslims’ military credibility. \nThe pre-Islamic beliefs and traditions (Al-Jahiliyah) which were at that time dying \nbecause of the strong decisive blow that they had already had at Hunain, could have \nhad a way to come back to life once again in such an environment. The hypocrites \nwho were conspiring against the Muslims so that they might stab them in the back \nwhereas Byzantines would attack them from the front. If such a thing came to light \nand they succeeded in their evil attempts, the Prophet and his Companions’ efforts to \nspread Islam would collapse and their profits which were the consequences of \nsuccessive and constant fights and invasions would be invalidated. The Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] realised all that very well. So — in spite of the hardships and drought \nthat Muslims were suffering from — the Prophet [pbuh] was determined that the \nMuslims should invade the Byzantines and fight a decisive battle at their own \nborders. He was determined not to tarry at all in order to thwart any Roman attempt \nto approach the land of Islam. \nWhen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had made up his mind and took his final \ndecision, he ordered his Companions to get ready for war and sent for the Makkans \nand the other Arab tribes asking for their assistance. \nContrary to his habit of concealing his real intention of the invasion by means of \ndeclaring a false one, he announced openly his intention of meeting the Byzantines \nand fighting them. He cleared the situation to his people so that they would get \nready, and urged them to fight in the way of Allâh. On this occasion a part of Sura",

To ‘Ali bin Abu Talib he entrusted his family’s \nsafety and affairs and ordered him to stay with them. This move made the hypocrites \nundervalue ‘Ali, so he followed the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and caught up with \nhim. But the Prophet made ‘Ali turn back to Madinah after saying: \"Would it not \nsuffice you to be my successor in the way that Aaron (Harun) was to Moses’?\" Then \nhe proceeded saying: \"But no Prophet succeeds me.\" \nOn Thursday, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] marched northwards to Tabuk. The \narmy that numbered thirty thousand fighters was a great one, when compared with \nthe previous armies of Islam. Muslims had never marched with such a great number \nbefore. \nDespite all the gifts of wealth and mounts the army was not perfectly equipped. The \nshortage of provisions and mounts was so serious that eighteen men mounted one \ncamel alternatively. As for provisions, members of the army at times had to eat the \nleaves of trees till their lips got swollen. Some others had to slaughter camels — \nthough they were so dear — so that they could drink the water of their stomach; \nthat is why that army was called \"The army of distress\". \nOn their way to Tabuk, the army of Islam passed by Al-Hijr — which was the native \nland of Thamud who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley; that is \"Al-Qura Valley\" of \ntoday. They watered from its well but later the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] told them \nnot to drink of that water, nor perform the ablution with it. The dough they made, he \nasked them to feed their camels with. He forbade them to eat anything whatsoever \nof it. As an alternative he told them to water from that well which Prophet Salih’s \nshe-camel used to water from. \nOn the authority of Ibn ‘Umar: \"Upon passing by Al-Hijr the Prophet [pbuh] said: \n\n276\n\"Do not enter the houses of those who erred themselves lest what had \nhappened to them would afflict you, but if you had to do such a thing let it \nbe associated with weeping.\" \nThen he raised his head up and accelerated his strides till he passed the valley out.\" \n[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/637] \nShortage of water and the army’s need to it made them complain to the Messenger \nof Allâh [pbuh] about that. So he supplicated Allâh, who sent a rainful cloud.

You will not get there before daytime. So whoever reaches it should \nnot touch its water; but wait till I come.\" Mu‘adh said: \"When we reached the spring \nit used to gush forth some water.

    "content": "eople Who lagged Behind \nDue to its particular circumstances, this invasion was a peculiar severe trial provided \nby Allâh only to try the believers’Faith and sort them out of others. This is Allâh’s \npermanent Will in such circumstances. In this respect He says: \n\"Allâh will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He \ndistinguishes the wicked from the good.\" [Al-Qur'an 3:179] \nLagging and hanging back from full participation in that invasion amounted to the \ndegree of hypocrisy. Whenever the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was informed of a \nman’s lingering, he would say: \"Leave him alone! If Allâh knows him to be good He \nwill enable him to follow you; but if he were not so, Allâh would relieve us of him.\" \nNobody stayed behind except those who were either hindered by a serious excuse or \nthe hypocrites who told lies to Allâh and His Messenger. \nSome of those hypocrites’ lingering was due to an excuse based on forgery and \ndelusion. Some others tarried but didn’t ask for an instant permission. But there \nwere three believers who unjustifiably lingered. They were the ones whom Allâh tried \ntheir Faith, but later on He turned to them in mercy and accepted their repentance. \nAs soon as the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had entered Madinah, he prayed two Rak‘a \nthen he sat to receive his people. The hypocrites who were over eighty men [Fath Al-\nBari 8/119] came and offered various kinds of excuses and started swearing. The \nProphet acknowledged their excuses and invoked Allâh’s forgiveness for them but he \nentrusted their inner thoughts and Faith to Allâh. \n\n279\nAs for the three faithful believers — Ka‘b bin Malik, Murara bin Ar-Rabi‘, and Hilal bin \nOmaiyah — who favoured telling the truth, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] bade his \nCompanions not to talk to them. \nConsequently they were subject to a severe boycott and were excluded from the life \nof the community. Everybody turned them their back. So they felt as if the whole \nland had become constrained to them in spite of its spaciousness and they felt \nawkward and uneasy. The hard times they lived and which lasted for over forty days \nwere towered by an order to them to forsake their wives. After fifty days’ boycott \nAllâh turned to them and revealed that in Qur’ân: \n\"And (He did forgive also) the three (whom the Prophet Õáì Çááå Úáíå æ \nÓáã) left (i.e. he did not give his judgement in their case, and their case was \nsuspended for Allâh’s Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was \nstraitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived \nthat there is no fleeing from Allâh, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He \naccepted their repentance, that they might repent (unto Him). Verily, Allâh \nis the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.\" [Al-Qur'an 9:118] \nAllâh’s turning to them was a great joy for both Muslims and the three concerned. \nThe joy of the stayers behind was unaccountable in aim and degree. It was the \nhappiest day in their lives. The good tiding cherished them and filled their hearts \nwith delight. As for those who lingered due to disability or sickness or any other \nserious excuse, Allâh, the Exalted said about them: \n\"There is no blame on those who are weak or ill or who find no resources to \nspend [in holy warfare (Jihad)], if they are sincere (in duty) to Allâh and His \nMessenger.\" [Al-Qur'an 9:91] \nWhen he approached Madinah, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: \n\"Inside Madinah, there are certain men, who though being left back due to \nserious excuses, they have, all the time, been with you. Lingerers as they \nare, they have been while you were passing valleys or walking along roads.\" \n\"Do you mean that they have done that while they are still in Madinah?\" \nThey wondered. \"",
    "enhanced_text": "eople Who lagged Behind \nDue to its particular circumstances, this invasion was a peculiar severe trial provided \nby Allâh only to try the believers’Faith and sort them out of others. This is Allâh’s \npermanent Will in such circumstances. In this respect He says: \n\"Allâh will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He \ndistinguishes the wicked from the good.\" [Al-Qur'an 3:179] \nLagging and hanging back from full participation in that invasion amounted to the \ndegree of hypocrisy. Whenever the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was informed of a \nman’s lingering, he would say: \"Leave him alone! If Allâh knows him to be good He \nwill enable him to follow you; but if he were not so, Allâh would relieve us of him.\" \nNobody stayed behind except those who were either hindered by a serious excuse or \nthe hypocrites who told lies to Allâh and His Messenger. \nSome of those hypocrites’ lingering was due to an excuse based on forgery and \ndelusion. Some others tarried but didn’t ask for an instant permission. But there \nwere three believers who unjustifiably lingered. They were the ones whom Allâh tried \ntheir Faith, but later on He turned to them in mercy and accepted their repentance. \nAs soon as the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had entered Madinah, he prayed two Rak‘a \nthen he sat to receive his people.

It was quite obvious to \neverybody that no power but Islam’s would live long among the Arabs. The \nremainders of Jahiliyin and hypocrites — who used to conspire steadily against the \nMuslims and who perpetually relied on Byzantine power when they were in need of \nsupport or help — these people lost their expectations and desires of ever reclaiming \ntheir ex-influence. Realizing that there was no way out and that they were to submit \nto the fait accompli, they gave up their attempts. \nFrom that time on, hypocrites were no longer treated leniently or even gently by the \nMuslims. Allâh not only bade Muslims to treat them severely but He also forbade \nthem to take their gift charities or perform prayer on their dead, or ask Allâh’s \n\n280\nforgiveness for them or even visit their tombs. Allâh bade the Muslims to demolish \nthe mosque, which they verily appointed and used as a hiding place where they \nmight practise their plots, conspiracy and deceit. Some Qur’ânic verses were sent \ndown disclosing them publicly and utterly so that everybody in Madinah got to know \ntheir reality. \nThe great impact that this invasion produced could be perceived in of the great \nnumber of delegations who came successively to meet the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh].

It was certainly the greatest. \n The Qur’ânic Verses Relating to this Invasion \nMany a verse of Bara’a (Tauba) Chapter handling the event of Tabuk were revealed. \nSome verses were revealed before the march, while others after setting out for \nTabuk, i.e. in the context of the battle. Some other verses were also revealed on the \nProphet’s arrival in Madinah. All of which covered the incidents that featured this \ninvasion: the immanent circumstances of the battle, exposure of the hypocrites, the \nprerogatives and special rank earmarked for the strivers in the cause of Allâh, \nacceptance of the repentance of the truthful believers who slackened and those who \nhung back, etc. \nSome Important Events that featured that Year \nDuring this year many events of great significance took place.

    "content": "282\nA Meditation on the Ghazawat \nMeditation on the Prophet’s Ghazawat, missions, and the battalions he formed and \ndispatched, will certainly give us and everybody a true and clear impression that the \nProphet [pbuh] was the greatest military leader in the whole world as well as the \nmost righteous, the most insightful and the most alert one. He was not a man of \nsuperior genius for this concern but he was also the Master and the greatest of all \nMessengers as far as Prophethood and Heavenly Message are concerned. Besides, all \nthe battles that he had fought were standard in their application to the requirements \nof strictness, bravery, and good arrangements that fitted the terms and conditions of \nwar. None of the battles he fought was lost as a consequence of shortage of wisdom \nor due to any other technical error in army mobilization or a location in a wrong \nstrategical position. The loss of any of his battle was not due to misjudgement about \noccupying the best and the most appropriate sites of battles, nor was it due to a \nmischoice of leaders of the fight, for he had proved himself to be a peculiar sort of \nleader that differs from any of those leaders that our world had known and \nexperienced. As regards Uhud and Hunain events, there were consequences of \nweakness in some military elements in Hunain; and disobedience to orders in Uhud. \nTheir non-compliance with wisdom and the plan of the battle played a passive role in \nthe course of those two invasions. \nHis genius was clearly shown in these two battles when the Muslims were defeated; \nfor he stoodfast facing the enemy and managed, by his super wisdom, to thwart the \nenemy’s aim as was the case in Uhud. Similarly he managed to change the Muslims’ \ndefeat in Hunain into a victory. Nothwithstanding the fact that serious grave \ndevelopments in military operations usually leave the worst impression on the \nmilitary leaders and entice them to flee for their lives. \nWe have, so far, discussed the mere aspects of military leadership of the invasions. \nOn the other hand, through these invasions he was able to impose security, institute \npeace, diffuse dissension and destroy the military might of the enemies through \nrelentless struggle between Islam and paganism. \nThe Prophet had also profound insight and could differentiate the faithful from the \nhypocrites and plotters. \nGreat was the group of military leaders who fought and excelled the Persians and the \nByzantines in the battlefields of Ash-Sham and Iraq with respect to war strategy and \nleading the fight procedures. The very leaders, who succeeded Muhammad [pbuh] , \nmanaged to drive off the enemies of Islam, from their lands and countries, their \ngardens and springs, and their farms. They drove them off their honourable \nresidence and from the grace and provisions they owned and enjoyed. Those Muslim \nleaders were all Muhammad’s men. They were imbued with the spirit of Islam at the \nhand of the Prophet [pbuh]. \nThanks to these battles, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] managed accommodation, \nsecured land and provided chances of work for all Muslims. He, even, made a lot of \ninquiries about the refugee problems who (then) had no houses or fortunes. He \nequipped the army with weapons, horses and expenditures. He had all that realized \nwithout exercising a particle weight of injustice. The Prophet [pbuh] has altered the \nstandards and aims of pre-Islamic wars. Their war was no more than robbing, killing, \nplundering, tyranny and aggression-oriented wars. Those wars focused on winning \n\n283\nvictory, oppressing the weakling and demolishing their houses and constructions. For \nthem, war was a means by which they can rape or unveil women, practise cruelty \nagainst the weakling, the babies and small children, spoil tillage and race, and \nspread corruption on the earth. Islamic wars are different from pre-Islamic wars. A \n\"war\" in Islam is a Jihad. That is to say it is a noble sacred fight in the way of Allâh \nfor the verification of a Muslim society that seeks to free man from oppression, \ntyranny and aggression. It is a society that everyone everywhere and at all times \nshould be proud of.Pre-Islamic thoughts and traditions of Al-Jahiliyah period have \nbeen turned upside down by Islam. These were so hard upon the weakling that they \nhad to invoke Allâh to enable them to get away from that pre-Islamic environment \nby saying: \n\"Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors, and raise \nfor us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will \nhelp.\" \nThe war of corruption, slaying and robbing that used to prevail has now turned into a \nsacred one, Al-Jihad. One of the greatest aims of Al-Jihad is to free man from the \naggression, the oppression and the tyranny of men of power. A man of power, in \nIslam, is a weakling till after the right of the poor is taken from him. War, in Islam, is \na Jihad for the purification of the land of Allâh from deception, treachery, sinful \ndeeds and aggression. It is a sacred war that aims at spreading security, safety, \nmercy and compassion as well as observing the rights and magnanimity. The \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] had issued honourable strict rules about war and bade his \nsoldiers and leaders to comply with them. They were forbidden to break those rules \nunder any circumstances. In reference to Sulaiman bin Buraidah’s version, who said \nthat his father had told him that whenever the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] appointed \na leader on an army or on a battalion, he used to recommend him to fear Allâh, the \nGreat and All-Mighty, when dealing with those who were closest to him and to be \ngood with all Muslims. Then the Prophet [pbuh] would say to him: \n\"Let your invasion be in the Name of Allâh and for His sake. Fight those who \ndisbelieve in Allâh. Invade but do not exaggerate nor commit treachery. \nNever deform the corpse of a dead person or kill an infant child.\" \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] asked people to facilitate but he forbade them to bear \ndown hard on others or constrain. \"Pacify\", he said, \"and do not disincline\". [Sahih \nMuslim 2/82,83] When it happened that he arrived at the battlefield by night, he \nwould never invade the enemy till it was morning. He utterly forbade burning (i.e. \ntorturing people) in fire, killing children and women or even beating them. He also \nforbade theft and robbery and proceeded so far as to say gains acquired through \nplundering are not less forbidden than the flesh of a corpse. Corruption of tillage and \nrace and cutting down of trees were all forbidden unless they were badly needed and \nthere was no other substitute: \n\"Do not kill a wounded person nor run after a fleeing one or kill a captive.\" \nHe decreed that envoys cannot be killed. He also stressed on not killing those who \nmade covenants. He even said: \n\n284\n\"He whoever kills one who is under pledge to a covenant shall not smell \nParadise, though its smell could be experienced at a forty-year distance \nfrom it.\" \nThere were some other noble rules which purified wars from their Al-Jahiliyah (pre-",

His keenness and carefulness to learn the \nQur’ân and study jurisprudence were clearly discernible through his behaviour \nduring their stay. \nEveryday morning, the group of delegates used to go and see the Messenger \nof Allâh [pbuh].

If it happened \nthat the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was asleep, he would then go to Abu Bakr \nfor the same purpose. With the passage of time, he turned out to be a source \nof blessing to his people. For at the Apostasy Times (Ar-Riddah) when Thaqif \nwere determined to apostatize, he addressed them saying: \"O, folkmen of \nThaqif! You have been the latest at embracing Islam, so do not be the first to \napostatize.\" Consequently they gave up apostasy and clung fast to Islam. \nThe group of delegates returned home but they were determined to conceal \nthe truth for a while.

They claimed that the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] demanded that they should embrace Islam and \nabandon adultery, drinking wine and dealing with usury and some other \nthings, or else he would fight them. Seized by the arrogance and zeal of Al-\nJahiliyah (pre-Islamic traditions), Thaqif remained for days intent on fighting. \nThen Allâh cast terror and dismay in their hearts in such a way that they gave \nup fighting and thought that the delegation should go back to him and \nannounce their approval. It was until then that the group of delegates told \nthem the truth and revealed the items of their peace-talk with the Prophet, \nconsequently Thaqif embraced Islam. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] sent some men to demolish the idol called \"Al-\nLat\" under the command of Khalid bin Al-Waleed.

    "content": "it was morning, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] told them what ‘Iesa \n(Jesus) was in the light of the recently revealed verses. He left them a whole \nday to consult and think it over. So when it was next morning and they still \nshowed disapproval to admit Allâh’s Words about ‘Isa or to embrace Islam, \nthe Prophet suggested Al-Mubahala that is each party should supplicate and \nimplore Allâh to send His Curse upon him or them if they were telling lies. \nAfter that suggestion of his, the Prophet [pbuh] came forward wrapping Al-\nHasan and Al-Husain under his garment whereas Fatimah was walking at his \nback. Seeing that the Prophet [pbuh] was serious and prepared to face them \nfirmly, they went aside and started consulting. Al-‘Aqib and As-Saiyid (i.e. the \nMaster) said to each other: \"We shall not supplicate. For, I swear by Allâh, if \nhe is really a Prophet and exchanges curses with us, we will never prosper \nnor will the descendants of ours. Consequently neither us nor our animals will \nsurvive it.\" Finally they made their mind to resort to the Messenger of Allâh’s \njudgement about their cause. They came to him and said: \"We grant you \nwhat you have demanded.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then admitted that \nagreement and ordered them to pay Al-Jizya (i.e. tribute) and he made peace \nwith them for the provision of two thousand garments, one thousand of them \nto be delivered in Rajab, the other thousand ones in Safar. With every \ngarment they had to pay an ounce (of gold). In return they will have the \ncovenant of Allâh and His Messenger.

    "enhanced_text": "it was morning, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] told them what ‘Iesa \n(Jesus) was in the light of the recently revealed verses. He left them a whole \nday to consult and think it over. So when it was next morning and they still \nshowed disapproval to admit Allâh’s Words about ‘Isa or to embrace Islam, \nthe Prophet suggested Al-Mubahala that is each party should supplicate and \nimplore Allâh to send His Curse upon him or them if they were telling lies. \nAfter that suggestion of his, the Prophet [pbuh] came forward wrapping Al-\nHasan and Al-Husain under his garment whereas Fatimah was walking at his \nback. Seeing that the Prophet [pbuh] was serious and prepared to face them \nfirmly, they went aside and started consulting. Al-‘Aqib and As-Saiyid (i.e. the \nMaster) said to each other: \"We shall not supplicate. For, I swear by Allâh, if \nhe is really a Prophet and exchanges curses with us, we will never prosper \nnor will the descendants of ours. Consequently neither us nor our animals will \nsurvive it.\" Finally they made their mind to resort to the Messenger of Allâh’s \njudgement about their cause. They came to him and said: \"We grant you \nwhat you have demanded.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then admitted that \nagreement and ordered them to pay Al-Jizya (i.e. tribute) and he made peace \nwith them for the provision of two thousand garments, one thousand of them \nto be delivered in Rajab, the other thousand ones in Safar. With every \ngarment they had to pay an ounce (of gold). In return they will have the \ncovenant of Allâh and His Messenger. He gave them a covenant that provides \nfor practicing their religious affairs freely. They asked the Prophet [pbuh] to \nappoint a trustworthy man to receive the money agreed on for peace, so he \nsent them the trustworthy man of this nation Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah to \nreceive the amounts of money agreed on in the peace treaty. \nBy the time Islam started to spread in Najran, naturally, they did not have to \npay Al-Jizya that usually non-Muslims paid.

    "content": "repeated the Prophet’s [pbuh]statements loudly at ‘Arafat was Rabi‘a \nbin Omaiyah bin Khalaf. [Ibn Hisham 2/605] \nAs soon as the Prophet [pbuh] had accomplished delivering the speech, the following \nQur’ânic verse was revealed to him: \n\"This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon \nyou, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\" [Al-Qur'an 5:3] \nUpon hearing this verse ‘Umar cried. \"What makes you cry?\" He was asked. His \nanswer was: \"Nothing succeeds perfection but imperfection.\" [Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/265] \nBilal called for prayer after the speech, and then made the second call. The Prophet \n[pbuh] performed both of the noon and the afternoon prayers separately, with no \nprayers in between. He then mounted his she-camel Al-Qaswa’, approached the \nlocation of the vigil, directed his face towards Al-Qiblah, kept on standing till sunset \nwhen the sky yellow colour vanished a bit and the disc of the sun disappeared. \nOsamah added that the Prophet [pbuh]moved onward to Muzdalifa. where he \nobserved the sunset and the evening prayers with one ‘First call’ and two ‘second \ncalls’. He did not entertain the Glory of Allâh between the two prayers. Then he lay \ndown till it was dawn prayer time. He performed it with one first call and one second \ncall at almost daybreak time. Mounting on his Al-Qaswa’, he moved towards Al-\nMash‘ar Al-Haram. He faced Al-Qiblah and started supplicating: \"Allâh is the \nGreatest. There is no god but Allâh.\" He remained there till it was clear morning and \nbefore the sun rose high, he made his way to Mina. He walked a little and threaded \nthe mid-road leading to the big Jamrah where he stopped and pelted seven pebbles \nat it saying \"Allâh is the Greatest\" each time. They were like small pebbles hurled \nfrom the bottom of the valley. Then he set off to the sacrificial place, where he \nsacrificed sixty-three camels with his hands, and asked ‘Ali to slaughter the others, a \nhundred and thirty-seven altogether. He made ‘Ali share him in Al-Hadi. A piece of \nmeat from each slaughtered animal was ordered to be cooked in a pot and from \nwhich both men ate, and drank the soup. \nThen the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] mounted his she-camel and returned to the \nHouse where he observed the noon prayer at Makkah and there he came upon the \nchildren of ‘Abdul Muttalib were supplying drinking water to people at Zamzam Well. \n\"Draw up water, children of ‘Abdul Muttalib, I would draw up with you if I were not \nafraid that people would appropriate this honour after me.\" They handed him a pail \nof water and he drank to his fill. [Sahih Muslim 1/397-400] \n\n301\nAt the daytime of the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah on the Slaughtering Day (Yaum An-Nahr) \nThe Prophet [pbuh] delivered another speech. That was at high time morning, while \nhe was mounting a grey mule. ‘Ali conveyed his statements to the people, who were \nstanding or sitting. [Abu Da'ud 1/270] He repeated some of the statements that he \nhad previously said the day before. The two Sheikh (Bukhâri and Muslim) reported a \nversion narrated by Abi Bakrah who said: \nThe Prophet [pbuh] made a speech on Yaum An-Nahr (day of slaughtering) and said: \n\"Time has grown similar in form and state to the time when Allâh created \nthe heavens and the earth. A year is twelve months. Four of which are \nSacred Months (Hurum). Three of the four months are successive. They are \nDhul-Qa‘dah, Dhul-Hijjah, and Al-Muharram. The fourth Month is Rajab \nMudar, which comes between Jumada and Sha‘ban.\" \n\"What month is this month?\" He asked. We said: \"Allâh and His Messenger \nknow best of all.\" He kept silent for a while till we thought he would attach \nto it a different appellation. \"Is it not Dhul-Hijjah?\" He wondered. \"Yes. It \nis.\" We said. Then he asked, \"What is this town called?\" We said: \"Allâh and \nHis Messenger know best of all.\" He was silent for a while till we thought he \nwould give it a different name. \"Is it not Al-Baldah? (i.e. the town)\" asked \nhe. \"Yes. It is.\" We replied. Then he asked again, \"What day is it today?\" We \nreplied: \"Allâh and His Messenger know best of all.\" Then he kept silent for \na while and said wondering: \"Is it not ‘An-Nahr’ (i.e. slaughtering) Day?\" \n\"Yes. It is.\" Said we. Then he said: \n\"(Shedding) the blood of one another and eating or taking one another’s \nprovisions (unwillingly) and your honour are all inviolable (Haram). It is \nunlawful to violate their holiness. They must be as sacred to one another as \nthis sacred day, in this sacred month, in this sacred town.\" \n\"You will go back to be resurrected (after death) to your Lord. There you \nwill be accounted for your deeds. So do not turn into people who go astray \nand kill one another.\" \n\"Have I not delivered the Message (of my Lord)?\" \"Yes you have.\" Said \nthey. \"O Allâh! Bear witness! Let him that is present convey it unto him who \nis absent. For haply, many people to whom the Message is conveyed may be \nmore mindful of it than the audience,.\" said he. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/234] \nIn another version it is said that the Prophet [pbuh] had said in that very speech: \n\"He whoever plunges into misfortune will certainly aggrieve himself. So let \nno one of you inflict an evil upon his parents. Verily Satan has utterly \ndespaired being worshipped in this country of yours; but he will be obeyed \nat your committing trivial things you disdain. Satan will be contented with \nsuch things.\" [At-Tirmidhi 2/38, 135; Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/234] \n\n302\nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] spent At-Tashreeq Days (11th, 12th and 13th of \nDhul-Hijjah) in Mina performing the ritual teachings of Islam, remembering Allâh \n(praying), following the ways of guidance of Ibrahim, wiping out all traces and \nfeatures or polytheism. On some days of At-Tashreeq he delivered some speeches as \nwell. In a version to Abu Da’ûd with good reference to Sira,’ the daughter of Nabhan; \nshe said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] made us a speech at the Ru’us (Heads) \nDay in which he said: \"Is it not this the middle day of At-Tashreeq Days.\" [Abu Da'ud \n1/269] \nHis speech that day was similar to that of An-Nahr Day’s. It was made after the \nrevelation of Surat An-Nasr. \nOn the second day of An-Nafr (i.e. Departure) — on the thirteenth of Dhul-Hijjah, the \nProphet [pbuh] proceeded with An-Nafr to Mina and stayed at a high place of a \nmountain side at Bani Kinanah from Al-Abtah. He spent the rest of that day and \nnight there — where he performed the noon, the afternoon, the sunset and the \nevening prayers. \nThen he slept for a short while and mounted leaving for the Ka‘bah. He performed \nthe Farewell Circumambulation (Tawaf Al-Wada‘), after ordering his Companions to \ndo the same thing. \nUpon the accomplishment of his religious rituals he quickened his move to the \npurified Madinah. He went there not to seek rest but to resume the strife and \nstruggle in the way of Allâh. [Sahih Al-",

Dark grief spread \non all areas and horizons of Madinah. Anas said: \n\"I have never witnessed a day better or brighter than that day on which the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh] came to us; and I have never witnessed a more \nawful or darker day than that one on which the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \ndied on.\" [Mishkat-ul-Masabih 2/547] \nWhen he died, Fatimah said: \"O Father, whom his Lord responded to his \nsupplication! O Father, whose abode is Paradise. O Father, whom I announce his \ndeath to Gabriel.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/641] \n‘Umar’s Attitude \n‘Umar, who was so stunned that he almost lost consciousness and stood before \npeople addressing them: \"Some of the hypocrites claim that the Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] died. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] did not die, but went to his Lord in the \nsame way as Moses bin ‘Imran did. He stayed away for forty nights, but finally came \nback though they said he had been dead. By Allâh, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nwill come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death.\" \n[Ibn Hisham 2/655] \n Abu Bakr’s Attitude \nAbu Bakr left his house at As-Sunh and came forth to the Mosque on a mare-back. \nAt the Mosque, he dismounted and entered. He talked to nobody but went on till he \nentered ‘Aishah’s abode, and went directly to where the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \nwas. The Prophet [pbuh] was covered with a Yemeni mantle. He uncovered his face \nand tended down, kissed him and cried. Then he said: \"I sacrifice my father and \nmother for your sake. Allâh, verily, will not cause you to die twice. You have just \nexperienced the death that Allâh had ordained.\" \nThen he went out and found ‘Umar talking to people. He said: \"‘Umar, be seated.\" \n‘Umar refused to do so. People parted ‘Umar and came towards Abu Bakr, who \nstarted a speech saying: \n\"And now, he who worships Muhammad [pbuh]. Muhammad is dead now. \nBut he who worships Allâh, He is Ever Living and He never dies. Allâh says: \n\n310\n‘Muhammad ([pbuh])is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) \nMessengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you \nthen turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on \nhis heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh, and Allâh will give reward \nto those who are grateful.’\" [Al-Qur'an 3:144] \nIbn ‘Abbas said: \"By Allâh, it sounded as if people had never heard such a Qur’ânic \nverse till Abu Bakr recited it as a reminder. So people started reciting it till there was \nno man who did not recite it.\" \nIbn Al-Musaiyab said that ‘Umar had said: \"By Allâh, as soon as I heard Abu Bakr \nsay it, I fell down to the ground.

    "content": "the greatest motives of all \nis Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had \nknown nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach \nthem to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the \nsolidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society. \nAn essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and \nwomen. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is \nimpossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] had to \nselect some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them \nsystematically in order to educate she-bedouins and townswomen, old and young, \nand thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The \nMothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet [pbuh]) were in such a convenient \nposition that they could convey the state of the Prophet [pbuh] and his affairs to \npeople (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of \nIslam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in \nconveying Prophetic traditions Ahadith to the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related \na large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements. \n\n314\nHis marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which \naimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of \nchildren. In Al-Jahiliyah the Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a \nreal son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That Jahiliyah \ntradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or \nuproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those \nconcerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and \nbrought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against \nsuch deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society. \nFor the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger [pbuh] to \nmarry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance \nwith Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when \nthe Confederates (Al-Ahzab) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] feared that the \nhypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to \ninfluence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce \nher, in order not to get involved into that trial. \nUndoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet \n[pbuh] . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had \nbeen sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying: \n\"And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha ÑÖì Çááå Úäå — \nthe freed slave of the Prophet [pbuh]) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace \n(by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad [pbuh] too) have done \nfavour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’ \nBut you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you \nthat He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make \nmanifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh] married the \ndivorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that \nyou should fear him.\" [Al-Qur'an 33:37] \nFinally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] married her at the \ntime he laid siege to Bani Quraiza. That was after she had finished her Iddat (i.e. \nperiod during which a widow or a divorcee may not remarry). Allâh Himself had \nalready ordained it, and so gave him no other alternative. Allâh had even started the \nmarriage Himself by saying: \n\"So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We \ngave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to \nthe believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons \nwhen the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced \nthem).\" [Al-Qur'an 33:37] \nAnd that was in order to break down the tradition o",
    "enhanced_text": "the greatest motives of all \nis Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had \nknown nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach \nthem to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the \nsolidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society. \nAn essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and \nwomen. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is \nimpossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] had to \nselect some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them \nsystematically in order to educate she-bedouins and townswomen, old and young, \nand thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The \nMothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet [pbuh]) were in such a convenient \nposition that they could convey the state of the Prophet [pbuh] and his affairs to \npeople (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of \nIslam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in \nconveying Prophetic traditions Ahadith to the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related \na large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements. \n\n314\nHis marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which \naimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of \nchildren. In Al-Jahiliyah the Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a \nreal son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That Jahiliyah \ntradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or \nuproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those \nconcerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and \nbrought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against \nsuch deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society. \nFor the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger [pbuh] to \nmarry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance \nwith Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when \nthe Confederates (Al-Ahzab) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] feared that the \nhypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to \ninfluence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce \nher, in order not to get involved into that trial. \nUndoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet \n[pbuh] . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had \nbeen sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying: \n\"And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha ÑÖì Çááå Úäå — \nthe freed slave of the Prophet [pbuh]) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace \n(by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad [pbuh] too) have done \nfavour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’ \nBut you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you \nthat He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make \nmanifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh] married the \ndivorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that \nyou should fear him.\" [Al-Qur'an 33:37] \nFinally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] married her at the \ntime he laid siege to Bani Quraiza.

But if you desire Allâh and His \nMessenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared \nfor Al-Muhsinat (good doers) amongst you an enormous reward.’\" [Al-Qur'an \n33:28,29] \nThey were so noble and honest that none of them preferred ‘the life of this world and \nits glitter’ to the abode in the Hereafter. \nAlthough they were many in number, nothing of the dispute occurrences that \nnormally happen among co-wives, took place in their houses. Very few cases could \nbe the only exception; but they were quite normal. Allâh reproached them for that, \nso they ceased to do such a thing. This incident is mentioned in At-Tahreem \nChapter: \n\"O Prophet! Why do you ban (for yourself) that which Allâh has made lawful \nto you …\" [Al-Qur'an 66:1] (to the end of the fifth verse). \nDiscussing polygamy — in my opinion — is not a necessity; since a person who is \nfamiliar with the Europeans, and indecent practices, sufferings, wickedness, their \nsorrows and distresses, the horrible crimes they commit in this respect as well as the \ntrials, the disasters that they are involved in, and which emanate directly from their \ndisregard of the principle of polygamy form a good reason (to justify the soundness \nof polygamy). The distorted picture of life in Europe with the ill-practices featuring it, \ncould truthfully justify the existence and practice of polyga",

Men’s dignity, devotion and estimation of the Messenger \nof Allâh [pbuh] were unique and matchless. No other man in the whole world has \nbeen so honoured and beloved. Those who knew him well, were fascinated and \nenchanted by him. They were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of saving a \nnail of his from hurt or injury. Being privileged by lots of prerogatives of perfection \nthat no one else had been endowed with, his Companions found that he was peerless \nand so they loved him. \nHere we list a brief summary of the versions about his beauty and perfection. To \nencompass all which is, addmittedly, beyond our power. \nBeauty of Creation \nDescribing the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who passed by her tent on his journey of \nmigration, Umm Ma‘bad Al-Khuza‘iyah said to her husband: \n\"He was innocently bright and had broad countenance. His manners were fine. Neither was his belly \nbulging out nor was his head deprived of hair. He had black attractive eyes finely arched by continuous \neyebrows. His hair glossy and black, inclined to curl, he wore long. His voice was extremely commanding. \nHis head was large, well formed and set on a slender neck. His expression was pensive and contemplative, \nserene and sublime. The stranger was fascinated from the distance, but no sooner he became intimate with \nhim than this fascination was changed into attachment and respect. His expression was very sweet and \ndistinct. His speech was well set and free from the use of superfluous words, as if it were a rosary of beads. \nHis stature was neither too high nor too small to look repulsive. He was a twig amongst the two, singularly \nbright and fresh. He was always surrounded by his Companions. Whenever he uttered something, the \nlisteners would hear him with rapt attention and whenever he issued any command, they vied with each \nother in carrying it out. He was a master and a commander. His utterances were marked by truth and \nsincerity, free from all kinds of falsehoods and lies.\"[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/45] \nAli bin Abi Talib describing him said: \"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was neither excessively tall nor \nextremely short. He was medium height among his friends. His hair was neither curly nor wavy. It was in \nbetween. It was not too curly nor was it plain straight. It was both curly and wavy combined. His face was \nnot swollen or meaty-compact. It was fairly round. His mouth was white. He had black and large eyes with \nlong haired eyelids. His joints (limbs) and shoulder joints were rather big. He had a rod-like little hair \nextending from his chest down to his navel, but the rest of his body was almost hairless. He had thick hand \npalms and thick fingers and toes. At walking, he lifted his feet off the ground as if he had been walking in a \nmuddy remainder of water. When he turned, he turned all. The Prophethood Seal was between his \nshoulders. He is the Seal of Prophets, the most generous and the bravest of all. \nHis speech was the most reliable. He was the keenest and the most attentive to people’s trust and was very \ncareful to pay people’s due in full. The Prophet [pbuh] was the most tractable and the most yielding \ncompanion, seeing him unexpectedly you fear him and venerate him. He who has acquaintance with him \nwill like him. He who describes him says: \n‘I have never seen such a person neither before nor after seeing him.’ \" [Ibn Hisham 1/401; Jami' At-Tirmidhi \n4/303] \n\n318\nJabir bin Samurah reported that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] had a broad face with reddish (wide) eyes and \nlean heels. [Sahih Al-Muslim 2/258] \nAbu At-Tufail said: \"He was white, good-looking. He was neither fat nor thin; neither tall nor short.\" \nAnas bin Malik said: \"He had unfolded hands and was pink-coloured. He was neither white nor brown. He \nwas rather whitish. In both his head and beard there were as many as twenty grey hairs, besides some grey \nhairs at his temples.\" In another version: \"and some scattered white hairs in his head.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/502] \nAbu Juhaifa said: \"I have seen some grey colour under his lower lip.\" Al-Bara’ said: \"He was of medium \nheight, broad-shouldered, his hair went up to his earlobes. I saw him dressed in a red garment and I (assure \nyou) I have never seen someone more handsome. At first he used to let his hair loose so as to be in \ncompliance with the people of the Book; but later on he used to part it.\" [ibid 1/503] \nAl-Bara’ also said: \"He had the most handsome face and the best character.\" When he was asked: \"Was the \nMessenger’s face sword-like?\" \"No,\" he said: \"it was moon-like.\" But in another version: he said, \"His face \nwas round.\" Ar-Rabi‘ bint Muawwidh said: \"Had you seen him, you would have felt that the sun was \nshining.\" Jabir bin Samurah said, \"I saw him at one full-moony night. I looked at him. He was dressed in a \nred garment. I compared him with the moon and found that — for me — he was better than the moon.\" \n[Mishkat Al-Masabeeh 2/518] \nAbu Huraira said: \"I have never seen a thing nicer than the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. It seems as if the \nsunlight were moving within his face. I have never seen one who is faster in pace than the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh]. It seemed as if the earth had folded itself up to shorten the distance for him. For we used to \nwear ourselves out while he was at full ease.\" [ibid 2/518] \nKa‘b bin Malik said: \"When he was pleased, his face would shine with so bright light that you would \nbelieve that it was a moon-piece.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/502] Once he sweated hot at ‘Aishah’s, and the \nfeatures of his face twinkled; so I recited a poem by Abu Kabeer Al-Hudhali: \n\"If you watch his face-features, you will see them twinkling like the lightning of an approaching rain.\" \n[Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/72] \nWhenever Abu Bakr saw him he would say: \n\"He is faithful, chosen (by Allâh), and calls for forgiveness. He shines like a full-moon light when it is far \nfrom dark (clouds).\" [Khulasa As-Siyar p.20] \n‘Umar used to recite verses by Zuhair describing Haram bin Sinan: \n\"Were you other than a human being, you would be a lighted moon at a full-moon night.\" \nThen he would add: \"Thus was the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. [ibid] \nWhen he got angry his face would go so red that you would think it were \"an \ninflected red skin-spot with pomegranate grains on both cheeks.\" [Mishkat Al-Masabeeh 1/22] \nJabir bin Samurah said: \"His legs were gentle, delicate and in conformity. His \nlaughter is no more than smiling. Looking at him will make you say ‘He is black-eyed \nthough he is not so.’\" [Jami' At-Tirmidhi 4/306] \n\n319\nIbn Al-‘Abbas said: \"His two front teeth were splitted so whenever he speaks, light \ngoes through them. His neck was as pure and silvery as a neck of doll. His eyelids \nwere long haired but his beard was thick. His forehead was broad; but his eyebrows \nwere like the metal piece attached to a lance, but they were unhorned. His nose was \nhigh-tipped, middle-cambered with narrow nostrils. His cheeks were plain, but he \nhad (little hair) running down like a rod from his throat to his navel. He had hair \nneither on his abdomen nor on his chest except some on his arms and shoulders. His \nchest was broad and flatted. He had long forearms with expansive palms of the \nhand. His legs were plain straight and stretching down. His other limbs were straight \ntoo. The two hollows of his soles hardly touch the ground. When he walks away he \nvanishes soon; but he walks at ease (when he is not in a hurry). The way he walks \nseems similar to one who is leaning forwards and is about to fall down.\" [Khulasa As-Siyar \np.19,20] \nAnas said: \"I have never touched silk or a silky garment softer than the palm of the \nProphet’s [pbuh]; nor have I smelt a perfume or any scent nicer than his.\" In \nanother version, \"I have never smelt ambergris nor musk nor any other thing \nsweeter than the scent and the smell of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].\" \nAbu Juhaifa said: \"I took his hand and put it on my head and I found that it was \ncolder than ice and better scented than the musk perfume.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/503] \nJabir bin Samurah — who was a little child then — said: \"When he wiped my cheek, I \nfelt it was cold and scented as if it had been taken out of a shop of a perfume \nworkshop.\" [Sahih Muslim 2/256] \nAnas said, \"His sweat was pearl-like.\" Umm Sulaim said: \"His sweat smelt nicer than \nthe nicest perfume.\" \nJabir said: \"Whoever pursues a road that has been trodden by the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh], will certainly scent his smell and will be quite sure that the Messenger \nof Allâh [pbuh] has already passed it.\" The Seal of Prophethood, which was similar in \nsize to a pigeon’s egg, was between his shoulders on the left side hav",

    "content": "es. [ibid 2/259] \nThe Perfection of Soul and Nobility \nThe Prophet [pbuh] was noted for superb eloquence and fluency in Arabic. He was \nremarkable in position and rank. He was an accurate, unpretending straightforward \nspeaker. He was well-versed in Arabic and quite familiar with the dialects and \naccents of every tribe. He spoke with his entertainers using their own accents and \ndialects. He mastered and was quite eloquent at both bedouin and town speech. So \nhe had the strength and eloquence of bedouin language as well as the clarity and the \ndecorated splendid speech of town. Above all, there was the assistance of Allâh \nembodied in the revealed verses of the Qur’ân. \nHis stamina, endurance and forgiveness — out of a commanding position — his \npatience and standing what he detested — these were all talents, attributes and \nqualities Allâh Himself had brought him on. Even wise men have their flaws, but the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], unlike everybody, the more he was hurt or injured, the \nmore clement and patient he became. The more insolence an ignorant anybody \nexercised against him the more enduring he became. \n\n320\n‘Aishah said: \n\"The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], whenever he is given the opportunity to \nchoose between two affairs, he always chooses the easiest and the most \nconvenient. But if he is certain that it is sinful, he will be as far as he could \nfrom it. He has never avenged himself; but when the sanctity of Allâh is \nviolated he would. That would be for Allâh’s not for himself. He is the last \none to get angry and the first to be satisfied. His hospitality and generosity \nwere matchless. His gifts and endowments manifest a man who does not \nfear poverty.\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/503] \nIbn‘Abbas said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] was the most generous. He is usually most \ngenerous of all times in Ramadan, the times at which the angel Gabriel [AWS] comes \nto see him. Gabriel used to visit him every night of Ramadan and review the Qur’ân \nwith him. Verily the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] is more generous at giving bounty or \ncharity than the blowing wind.\" \nJabir said: \n\"The Prophet [pbuh] would never deny anything he was asked for.\"[Sahih Al-\nBukhari 1/503] \nHis courage, his succour and his might are distinguishable. He was the most \ncourageous. He witnessed awkward and difficult times and stoodfast at them. More \nthan once brave men and daring ones fled away leaving him alone; yet he stood with \nfull composure facing the enemy without turning his back. All brave men must have \nexperienced fleeing once or have been driven off the battlefield at a round at a time \nexcept the Prophet [pbuh]. ‘Ali said: \"Whenever the fight grew fierce and the eyes of \nfighters went red, we used to resort to the Prophet [pbuh] for succour. He was \nalways the closest to the enemy.\" [As-Shifa 1/89] \nAnas said: \"One night the people of Madinah felt alarmed. People went out hurriedly \ntowards the source of sound, but the Prophet [pbuh] had already gone ahead of \nthem. He was on the horseback of Abu Talhah which had no saddle over it, and a \nsword was slung round his neck, and said to them: ‘There was nothing to be afraid \nfor.’\" [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/407; Sahih Muslim 2/252] \nHe was the most modest and the first one to cast his eyes down. Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudri \nsaid: \"He was shier than a virgin in her boudoir. When he hates a thing we read it on \nhis face. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/504] He does not stare at anybody’s face. He always \ncasts his eyes down. He looks at the ground more than he looks sky-wards. His \nutmost looks at people are glances. He is willingly and modestly obeyed by \neverybody. He would never name a person whom he had heard ill-news about — \nwhich he hated. Instead he would say: ‘Why do certain people do so....’\" \nAl-Farazdaq verse of poem fits him very much and the best one to be said of: \n\"He casts his eyes modestly but the eyes of others are cast down due to his \nsolemnity, and words issue out of his mouth only while he is smiling.\" \nThe Prophet [pbuh] is the most just, the most decent, the most truthful at speech, \nand the honestest of all. Those who have exchanged speech with him, and even his \n\n321\nenemies, acknowledge his noble qualities. Even before the Prophethood he was \nnicknamed Al-Ameen (i.e. the truthful, the truthworthy). Even then — in Al-Jahiliyah \n— they used to turn to him for judgement and consultation. In a version by At-\nTirmidhi, he says that ‘Ali had said that he had been told by Abu Jahl that he (Abu \nJahl) said to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]: \"We do not call you a liar; but we do not \nhave faith in what you have brought.\" [Mishkat Al-Masabeeh 2/521] In His Book, Allâh, the \nExalted, said about them: \n\"It is not you that they deny, but it is the Verses (the Qur’ân) of Allâh that \nthe Zalimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) deny.\" [Al-Qur'an 6:33] \nEven when Heraclius asked Abu Sufyan: \"Have you ever accused him of lying before \nthe ministry of Prophethood?\" Abu Sufyan said: \"No.\" \nHe was most modest and far from being arrogant or proud. He forbade people to \nstand up at his presence as other people usually do for their kings. \nVisiting the poor, the needy and entertaining them are some of his habits. If a slave \ninvited him, he would accept the invitation. He always sat among his friends as if he \nwere an ordinary person of them. ‘Aishah said that he used to repair his shoes, sew \nor mend his dress and to do what ordinary men did in their houses. After all, he was \na human being like others. He used to check his dress (lest it has some insects on). \nMilking the she-sheep and catering for himself were some of his normal jobs. [ibid \n2/520] The Prophet [pbuh] was the most truthful to his pledges, and it is one of his \nqualities to establish good and steady relationship with his relatives — ‘Silat-Ar-\nRahim’. He is the most merciful, gentle and amiable to all people. His way of living is \nthe simplest one. Ill-manners and indecency are two qualities completely alien to \nhim. He was decent, and did not call anybody names. He was not the sort of person \nwho cursed or made noise in the streets. He did not exchange offences with others. \nHe pushed back an offence or an error by forgiveness and overlooking. Nobody was \nallowed to walk behind him (i.e. as a bodyguard). He did not feel himself superior to \nothers not even to his slaves (men or women) as far as food or clothes were \nconcerned. \nWhoever served him should be served by him too. ‘Ugh’ (an utterance of complaint) \nis a word that had never been said by him to his servant; nor was his servant \nblamed for doing a thing or leaving it undone. Loving the poor and the needy and \nentertaining them or participating in their funerals were things the Prophet [pbuh] \nalways observed. He never contempted or disgraced a poor man for his poverty. \nOnce he was travelling with his Companions and when it was time to have food \nprepared, he asked them to slaughter a she-sheep. A man said: I will slaughter it, \nanother one said: I will skin it out. A third said: I will cook it. So the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] said: I will collect wood for fire. They said: \"No. We will suffice you that \nwork.\" \"I know that you can do it for me, but I hate to be privileged. Allâh hates to \nsee a slave of his privileged to others.\" So he went and collected fire-wood. [Khulasa As-\nSiyar p.22] \nLet us have some of the description of Hind bin Abi Halah: \"The Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] was continually sad, thinking perpetually. He had no rest (i.e. for long). He \nonly spoke when it was necessary. He would remain silent for a long time and \nwhenever he spoke, he would end his talk with his jawbone but not out of the \ncorners of his mouth, i.e. (snobbishly). His speech was inclusive. He spoke \n\n322\ninclusively and decisively. It was not excessive nor was it short of meaning. It was \namiable. It was in no way hard discoroning. He glorified the bounty of Allâh; even if \nit were little. If he had no liking for someone’s food, he would neither praise nor \ncriticize. \nHe was always in full control of his temper and he would never get seemed angry \nunless it was necessary. He never got angry for himself nor did he avenge himself. It \nwas for Allâh’s sanctity and religion that he always seemed angry. \nWhen he pointed at a thing he would do so with his full hand-palm, and he would \nturn it round to show surprise. If he were angry he would turn both his body and \nface aside. When he was pleased, he cast his eyes down. His laughter was mostly \nsmiling. It was then that his teeth which were like hail-stones were revealed. \nHe never spoke unless it was something closely relevant to him. He confirmed the \nbrotherhood relationship among his Companions; and thus he made them intimate \nand did not separate them or implant enmity among them. Those who were \nhonourable with their peoples, were honoured and respected by him and were \nassigned rulers over their own peoples. His cheerfulness was never withdrawn at \nanyone’s face; even at those whom he warned his people from or those whom he \nhimself was on the alert of. He visited friends and inquired about people’s affairs. He \nconfirmed what was right and criticized the awful and tried to undermine it. He was \nmoderate in all affairs. He was equal to others and was not privileged. He would \nnever act heedlessly, lest the others should get heedless. Each situation was dealt \nwith in its proper due. \nRighteousness was his target; so he was never short of it nor indifferent to it. People \nwho sat next to him were the best of their people and the best of them all were — \nfor him — those who provided common consultations. For him, the greatest ones and \nthe highest in ranks were the best at providing comfort and co-ordination and \nsuccour. Remembrance (of Allâh) was a thing he aimed at and established whenever \nhe sat down or stands up. No certain position was assigned for him to sit on. He sits \nat the end of the group, seated next to the last sitter in the place. He ordered people \nto do the same. He entertained his participiants in social gatherings alike so that the \none addressed would think that there was no one honoured by the Prophet [pbuh] \nbut himself. He whoever sat next to him or interrupted him in order to ask for his \nadvice about an affair of his, would be the first to start the talk and the one to end it. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] would listen to him patiently till he ended his speech. He never \ndenied a request to anyone, if unapproachable, then few gratifying words would \nwork, instead. \nHis magnanimity, broad mindedness his tolerance could embrace all people and \nentitled him to be regarded as father for them all. In justice, all of them were almost \nequal. Nobody was better than another except on the criterion of Allâh fearing. A \nfavoured one, to him, was the most Allâh fearing. His assembly was a meeting of \nclemency, timidness, patience and honesty. Voices were not raised in rows or riots. \nInviolable things were never violable. Fearing Allâh and worship were their means to \nsympathy and compassion. They used to esteem the old and have mercy on the \nyoung. They assisted the needy and entertained strangers. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was always cheerful, easy, pleasant-tempered and \nlenient. He was never rude or rough nor clamorous or indecent. He was neither a \n\n323\nreproacher nor a praiser. He overlooked what he did not desire, yet you would never \ndespair of him. Three qualities he disposed of: hypocrisy, excessiveness, and what \nwas none of his concern. People did not fear him in three areas: — for they were not \nqualities or habits of his —: He never disparaged, or reproached nor did he seek the \ndefects or shortages of others. He only spoke things whose reward was Divinely \ndesirable. When he spoke, his listeners would attentively listen casting down their \nheads. They only spoke when he was silent. They did not have disputes or \narguments about who was to talk. He who talked in his presence would be listened to \nby everybody till he finished his talk. Their talk would be about the topic discussed or \ndelivered by their first speaker. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] used to laugh at what \nthey laughed at and admired what they used to admire. He would always show \npatience with a stranger’s harshness at talk. He used to say: \n\"When you see a person seeking an object earnestly, assist him to get his \nneed. And never ask for a reward except from the reward-Giver, i.e. Allâh.\" \n[Ash-Shifa 1/126] \nKharijah bin Zaid said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] was the most honoured among the \npeople with whom he sat. His limbs could hardly be seen. He was often silent and \nrarely talked when speech was not a necessity. He turned away from those whose \nspeech was rude or impolite. His laughter was no more than a smile. His speech, \nwhich was decisive, it was neither excessive nor incomplete. Out of reverence and \nesteem and following the example of their Prophet [pbuh], the Companions’ laughter \nat his presence — was smiling, as well.\" [As-Shifa 1/107] \nOn the whole the Prophet [pbuh] was ornamented with peerless attributes of \nperfection. No wonder to be like that for he was brought up, educated and taught \n(the Qur’ân) by Allâh. He was even praised by Allâh: \n\"And verily, you (O Muhammad [pbuh] ) are on an exalted standard of \ncharacter.\" [Al-Qur'an 68:4] \nThose were the attributes and qualities that the Prophet [pbuh] enjoyed which made \nthe hearts of souls of the people close to him, draw near to him and love him. Those \ntraits made him so popular that the restraint and enmity of his people grew less and \nthey started to embrace Islam in large crowds. \nThis description is in fact no more than a rapid review or rather short brief lines of \nMuhammad’s [pbuh] aspects of full perfection. Trying to encompass the whole \nperfect picture of the Prophet [pbuh]. No one can ever claim to be possessed of full \nknowledge or complete mastery of the great attributes of the greatest man in this \nuniverse. No one can ever give this man, the top of perfection, his due descrpition. \nHe was a man who always sought Allâh’s light, to such an extent that he was wholly \nimbued with the Qur’ânic approach. \nO Allâh! send your blessings (and the Holy Words of Yours) upon Muhammad and the \nfamily of Muhammad, as You have send blessings upon Ibrâhim and the family of",

He forbade people to \nstand up at his presence as other people usually do for their kings. \nVisiting the poor, the needy and entertaining them are some of his habits. If a slave \ninvited him, he would accept the invitation. He always sat among his friends as if he \nwere an ordinary person of them. ‘Aishah said that he used to repair his shoes, sew \nor mend his dress and to do what ordinary men did in their houses. After all, he was \na human being like others. He used to check his dress (lest it has some insects on). \nMilking the she-sheep and catering for himself were some of his normal jobs. [ibid \n2/520] The Prophet [pbuh] was the most truthful to his pledges, and it is one of his \nqualities to establish good and steady relationship with his relatives — ‘Silat-Ar-\nRahim’. He is the most merciful, gentle and amiable to all people. His way of living is \nthe simplest one. Ill-manners and indecency are two qualities completely alien to \nhim. He was decent, and did not call anybody names. He was not the sort of person \nwho cursed or made noise in the streets. He did not exchange offences with others. \nHe pushed back an offence or an error by forgiveness and overlooking. Nobody was \nallowed to walk behind him (i.e. as a bodyguard). He did not feel himself superior to \nothers not even to his slaves (men or women) as far as food or clothes were \nconcerned. \nWhoever served him should be served by him too. ‘Ugh’ (an utterance of complaint) \nis a word that had never been said by him to his servant; nor was his servant \nblamed for doing a thing or leaving it undone. Loving the poor and the needy and \nentertaining them or participating in their funerals were things the Prophet [pbuh] \nalways observed. He never contempted or disgraced a poor man for his poverty. \nOnce he was travelling with his Companions and when it was time to have food \nprepared, he asked them to slaughter a she-sheep. A man said: I will slaughter it, \nanother one said: I will skin it out. A third said: I will cook it. So the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] said: I will collect wood for fire. They said: \"No. We will suffice you that \nwork.\" \"I know that you can do it for me, but I hate to be privileged. Allâh hates to \nsee a slave of his privileged to others.\" So he went and collected fire-wood. [Khulasa As-\nSiyar p.22] \nLet us have some of the description of Hind bin Abi Halah: \"The Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] was continually sad, thinking perpetually. He had no rest (i.e. for long). He \nonly spoke when it was necessary. He would remain silent for a long time and \nwhenever he spoke, he would end his talk with his jawbone but not out of the \ncorners of his mouth, i.e. (snobbishly). His speech was inclusive. He spoke \n\n322\ninclusively and decisively. It was not excessive nor was it short of meaning. It was \namiable. It was in no way hard discoroning. He glorified the bounty of Allâh; even if \nit were little. If he had no liking for someone’s food, he would neither praise nor \ncriticize. \nHe was always in full control of his temper and he would never get seemed angry \nunless it was necessary. He never got angry for himself nor did he avenge himself. It \nwas for Allâh’s sanctity and religion that he always seemed angry. \nWhen he pointed at a thing he would do so with his full hand-palm, and he would \nturn it round to show surprise. If he were angry he would turn both his body and \nface aside. When he was pleased, he cast his eyes down. His laughter was mostly \nsmiling. It was then that his teeth which were like hail-stones were revealed. \nHe never spoke unless it was something closely relevant to him. He confirmed the \nbrotherhood relationship among his Companions; and thus he made them intimate \nand did not separate them or implant enmity among them. Those who were \nhonourable with their peoples, were honoured and respected by him and were \nassigned rulers over their own peoples. His cheerfulness was never withdrawn at \nanyone’s face; even at those whom he warned his people from or those whom he \nhimself was on the alert of. He visited friends and inquired about people’s affairs. He \nconfirmed what was right and criticized the awful and tried to undermine it. He was \nmoderate in all affairs. He was equal to others and was not privileged. He would \nnever act heedlessly, lest the others should get heedless. Each situation was dealt \nwith in its proper due. \nRighteousness was his target; so he was never short of it nor indifferent to it. People \nwho sat next to him were the best of their people and the best of them all were — \nfor him — those who provided common consultations. For him, the greatest ones and \nthe highest in ranks were the best at providing comfort and co-ordination and \nsuccour. Remembrance (of Allâh) was a thing he aimed at and established whenever \nhe sat down or stands up. No certain position was assigned for him to sit on. He sits \nat the end of the group, seated next to the last sitter in the place. He ordered people \nto do the same. He entertained his participiants in social gatherings alike so that the \none addressed would think that there was no one honoured by the Prophet [pbuh] \nbut himself. He whoever sat next to him or interrupted him in order to ask for his \nadvice about an affair of his, would be the first to start the talk and the one to end it. \nThe Prophet [pbuh] would listen to him patiently till he ended his speech. He never \ndenied a request to anyone, if unapproachable, then few gratifying words would \nwork, instead. \nHis magnanimity, broad mindedness his tolerance could embrace all people and \nentitled him to be regarded as father for them all. In justice, all of them were almost \nequal. Nobody was better than another except on the criterion of Allâh fearing. A \nfavoured one, to him, was the most Allâh fearing. His assembly was a meeting of \nclemency, timidness, patience and honesty. Voices were not raised in rows or riots. \nInviolable things were never violable. Fearing Allâh and worship were their means to \nsympathy and compassion. They used to esteem the old and have mercy on the \nyoung. They assisted the needy and entertained strangers. \nThe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was always cheerful, easy, pleasant-tempered and \nlenient. He was never rude or rough nor clamorous or indecent. He was neither a \n\n323\nreproacher nor a praiser. He overlooked what he did not desire, yet you would never \ndespair of him. Three qualities he disposed of: hypocrisy, excessiveness, and what \nwas none of his concern. People did not fear him in three areas: — for they were not \nqualities or habits of his —: He never disparaged, or reproached nor did he seek the \ndefects or shortages of others. He only spoke things whose reward was Divinely \ndesirable. When he spoke, his listeners would attentively listen casting down their \nheads. They only spoke when he was silent. They did not have disputes or \narguments about who was to talk. He who talked in his presence would be listened to \nby everybody till he finished his talk. Their talk would be about the topic discussed or \ndelivered by their first speaker. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] used to laugh at what \nthey laughed at and admired what they used to admire. He would always show \npatience with a stranger’s harshness at talk. He used to say: \n\"When you see a person seeking an object earnestly, assist him to get his \nneed. And never ask for a reward except from the reward-Giver, i.e. Allâh.\" \n[Ash-Shifa 1/126] \nKharijah bin Zaid said: \"The Prophet [pbuh] was the most honoured among the \npeople with whom he sat. His limbs could hardly be seen. He was often silent and \nrarely talked when speech was not a necessity. He turned away from those whose \nspeech was rude or impolite. His laughter was no more than a smile. His speech, \nwhich was decisive, it was neither excessive nor incomplete. Out of reverence and \nesteem and following the example of their Prophet [pbuh], the Companions’ laughter \nat his presence — was smiling, as well.\" [As-Shifa 1/107] \nOn the whole the Prophet [pbuh] was ornamented with peerless attributes of \nperfection. No wonder to be like that for he was brought up, educated and taught \n(the Qur’ân) by Allâh. He was even praised by Allâh: \n\"And verily, you (O Muhammad [pbuh] ) are on an exalted standard of \ncharacter.\" [Al-Qur'an 68:4] \nThose were the attributes and qualities that the Prophet [pbuh] enjoyed which made \nthe hearts of souls of the people close to him, draw near to him and love him. Those \ntraits made him so popular that the restraint and enmity of his people grew less and \nthey started to embrace Islam in large crowds. \nThis description is in fact no more than a rapid review or rather short brief lines of \nMuhammad’s [pbuh] aspects of full perfection. Trying to encompass the whole \nperfect picture of the Prophet [pbuh]. No one can ever claim to be possessed of full \nknowledge or complete mastery of the great attributes of the greatest man in this \nuniverse. No one can ever give this man, the top of perfection, his due descrpition. \nHe was a man who always sought Allâh’s light, to such an extent that he was wholly \nimbued with the Qur’ânic approach. \nO Allâh! send your blessings (and the Holy Words of Yours) upon Muhammad and the \nfamily of Muhammad, as You have send blessings upon Ibrâhim and the family of",
